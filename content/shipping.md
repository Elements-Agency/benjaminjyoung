## Delivery ##

### When will I get my order? ###

Usually, for **limited reproductions**, it takes 1–5 business days to fulfill an order, after which it’s shipped out. Typically this translates to 2-7 days shipment times for the Standard Shipping (or Free Domestic) option, and 1-2 days for the Expedited Shipping option.

For **originals**, it's more of direct relation process. I will stay in touch with you directly to ensure everything goes smoothly. It's best to [contact me](/contact) prior to ordering for more information. While the painting is all ready to go, packaging is done very carefully to ensure no damage in shipping. I will give you a delivery estimate personally, and you can get a full refund any time prior to confirming and finalizing shipment. Shipment times usually are 3-10 business days.

### Where will my order ship from? ###

For **limited reproductions**, I have a quality print distributed vendor I partnered with. It will depend on the ordering location based on which facility they ship from.

For **originals**, will always be shipped from Canton Ohio, directly from my studio. One exception to this, is if the piece is being held at an exhibit, which the painting description will detail.

### Do you ship outside of the United States? ###

Yes. Please [contact me](/contact) to discuss further details.

### Will I be charged customs for my order? ###

An additional customs and tax fee can occur on international orders. This fee is not in our control and is assessed by your local customs office. Customs policies vary widely for every country so please check with your local customs office directly to see if they apply duties and taxes to your purchases.

### My order should be here by now, but I still don't have it. What should I do? ###

Before getting in touch with us, please help us out by doing the following:

  * Check your shipping confirmation email for any mistakes in the delivery address
  * Ask your local post office if they have your package
  * Stop by your neighbors in case the courier left the package with them

If the shipping address was correct, and the package wasn't left at the post office or at your neighbor’s, [get in touch with me](/contact) with your order number.
