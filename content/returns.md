### What’s your return policy? ###

I do not offer returns and exchanges, but if there’s something wrong with your order, please let me know by [contacting me](/contact)!

### Do you offer refunds? ###

Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or damaged items. If any of these apply, please [contact me](/contact) with photos of wrong/damaged items and I will sort that out for you.

### Can I exchange an item for a different size/color? ###

At this time, I don't offer exchanges. If you’re unsure which size would fit better, check out our sizing charts—we have one for every item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though rare, it's possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If that’s the case, [please let me know](/contact) within a week after receiving your order. Include your order number and photos of the mislabeled item, and I will send you a new one, or issue a refund!

### Contact Us ###
