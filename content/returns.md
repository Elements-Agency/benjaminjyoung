### What’s your return policy? ###

I do not offer returns and exchanges, but if there’s something wrong with your order, please let me know by [contacting me](/contact)!

### Do you offer refunds? ###

Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or damaged items. If any of these apply, please [contact me](/contact) with photos of wrong/damaged items and I will sort that out for you.

### Can I exchange an item for a different size/color? ###

At this time, I don't offer exchanges. Though rare, it's possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If that’s the case, [please let me know](/contact) within a week after receiving your order. Include your order number and photos of the mislabeled item, and I will send you a new one, or issue a refund!
