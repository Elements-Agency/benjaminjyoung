<h1>The Story Behind the Paintings</h1>
{{< preview painting="/artwork/one-last-walk-with-izzy/" caption="One Last Walk With Izzy" style="right small" >}}
<p>
    Every painting I create is more than a composition of color and form — it’s an emotional narrative drawn from lived experience, memory, and the moments that shape a life.
    My work blends intimate human feeling with narrative realism, inviting you not just to see the art, but to feel it.
</p>

<p>
    From quiet moments of reflection and loss to the resilience found in healing, each piece serves as a chapter in a larger story.
    Whether it’s the gentle quiet of <a href="/artwork/coming-home/">Coming Home</a>, a testament of grief and hope in <a href="/artwork/final-embrace/">Final Embrace</a>, or the tender warmth amid shadow in <a href="/artwork/in-the-dark/">In The Dark</a>, my paintings sit at the intersection of emotional truth and visual expression.
</p>
