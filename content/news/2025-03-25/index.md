My objective priorities when painting will forever remain "emotions first, values second, colors third." I have been taking the past first year of myself practicing to learn the latter two, but now that I have a decent amount of skill built, it's time for me to focus on my first priority; emotion.

<!--more-->

While each piece I plan and paint must objectively stand on it's own, deeper emotions must come from stories, with context and complicity. When I started painting, I had one specific painting planned in mind. That painting demands a great deal of respect and context before I can begin it. While I have yet to begin this painting, I have began painting that context.

My most recent paintings have taken us in to more recent years of my life, during a time I was traumatically broken, as I need to provide a current precursor snapshot before tackling both my most cherished story and the endgame timeline. I have finally completed three pieces that fit closely together, all within a few months of the winter of 2019-2020. The time is an incredible pivotal moment of my life, at the low point between two highs.

    {{< preview col="4" painting="/artwork/final-embrace/" >}}
{{< row-end >}}

The **One Last December** [collection](/collections/one-last-december) currently includes three paintings; [Hallelujah](/artwork/hallelujah), [Snowfall](/artwork/snowfall), and [Embrace](/artwork/embrace). The latter two both happening the same night, of [February 26th](/collections/feb-26), 2020, with Hallelujah being the moment to delay and disrupt these events.

## What's Next? ##

[Hallelujah](/artwork/hallelujah) was the first of a trio of oil paintings I had planned, called [The Dark Trio](/collections/the-dark-trio). From here, it's time to finish the next two. All three are titled after song tiles. The second being "Unfaithful", and the third/final being "Show Me What You Are Looking For". The final piece of this trio is also the beginning to **The Hart's Desire** collection that will take you back to 2011 to finally begin that all important story.

Not everything I paint fits in to this timeline, but my more important pieces do. I have began documenting this timeline out, even with the unfinished but planned paintings. As more pieces are completed, I will add further and further context.

I will also have a few upcoming paintings I'm working on that will be scattered throughout this timeline, further expanding on little details that tie together.

## Escape Series Also Completed ##

While I started my [Escape](/artwork/escape) and it's other iterations last year, it wasn't until this year I put the final touches on the conclusion piece.

    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/gehen-heim/" >}}
    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/just-out-of-reach/" >}}

This narrative series was done to help me practice and learn different watercolor techniques.

## Originals Paintings Sold ##

I have four originals sold this season:

{{< row-start >}}
    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/one-last-walk-with-izzy/" >}}
    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/okay-now/" >}}
    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/tomb-flowers/" >}}
    {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/massillon-52/" >}}
{{< row-end >}}

I'm struggling currently holding on to pieces long enough keep them for upcoming shows, so it may require I increase original artwork prices in the future. As of right now, I have not changed my pricing model, but it's a highly likely possibility soon.
