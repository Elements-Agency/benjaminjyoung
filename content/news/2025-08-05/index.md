I have been holding off on being too public or opening [my new studio space](/contact). I needed time for myself to withdraw from the youth-filled local art scene and feel more at peace with my own company. I have been holding off on exhibits and being too public with any presence. However, with a supportive and loving partner by my side, I have found enough warmth not to continue to avoid the cold of the world.

<!--more-->

I have been learning the harsh reality over the past year, unwarranted cruelty exists for any emerging artist in the cities of Canton and Massillon, Ohio. Any talent is challenged with verbal assaults and vindictive gossip. There’s a small but loud collective that preaches love but spits poison. Their gossip is about anyone and everyone, including their own. It’s been a challenging adjustment for me, especially from the peaceful, sparse tribalism in the rolling country hills, which is usually judgment-free. This social city life is not something I want any part of.

But how do I react to this toxicity? It hit me with a reminder this past First Friday. A young couple had stopped by my studio to browse some of my paintings I had hung up in the hallway. I have welcomed this couple many times over the past year, especially in my previous studio at Patina Arts Centre. All of my interactions have been friendly and professional. They were unaware I had just walked out of my office and was patiently waiting to greet them. The one pointed at a reproduction of [The Artist’s Assistant](/artwork/the-artists-assistant/), saying how she adored the cat. Her partner agreed, but then verbalized a negative comment against me. One that I will not repeat. Turning around immediately after making her statement, and realized I was directly there to hear it. With a prideful laugh and no remorse, she just started walking away with her nose held high. So, how do I respond? With a kind and warm smile and calmly watch them be on their way.

The world doesn’t need any more coldness. This wasn’t the first cruel experience in the local art world for me this year, and it won’t be the last. These mean-spirted occurrences seem to a common as of late. I don’t need to add any more coldness to the world. While I admit these everyday acts hurt, I am only human, I will not entertain them.

This brings me to the true reason I painted “[In The Dark](/artwork/in-the-dark)”, which I now want to revisit and be open about.

The women in my [Halleluja](/artwork/hallelujah) painting introduced me to Robert Frost’s poem, Fire and Ice. I have dissent for both the women’s personal views and the conclusion of Frost’s poem. Accepting the world should end in ice is an analogy for watching the world end in hate, cruelty, and coldness. I would rather see the world burn up in desire. Ashes filled with love, kindness, empathy, care, all from desire.

[In The Dark](/artwork/in-the-dark) was always intended from the concept as a protest against the local art scene’s clique coldness. No matter how cold and dark the world gets around me, I will tend to my little flame and keep it burning. [Most of my work](/featured) is meant to feel cold and melancholic, so I can intentionally contrast those with more powerful and bright paintings. Paintings like [In The Dark](/artwork/in-the-dark), [Okay Now](/artwork/okay-now), or [One Last Walk With Izzy](/artwork/one-last-walk-with-izzy]. My past bad memories will make you savor the good ones. I’m not painting for the people who don’t enjoy my art, or who dislike the idea they have of me. I’m painting for myself and the people my work moves. I will not let my flame burn out.

With all that said, I announce the opening of my studio doors to the public again, with a grand opening this next First Friday. Also, I have a list of upcoming announcements of exhibitions I will be taking part in again for the rest of the year. Finally, work will now begin on two planned paintings. One being the darkest moment of my life, and the other will be the brightest moment of my life.

## New Artwork - Pearl’s Granddaughter ##

{{< row-start >}}
    {{< preview col="6" painting="/artwork/pearls-granddaughter/" >}}
{{< row-end >}}

**Pearl’s Granddaughter** is my first gouache painting is a compelling reinterpretation of Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, replacing the original’s soft elegance with a bolder, more contemporary edge. The subject’s vivid orange headscarf adds a striking contrast to the dark background, drawing immediate attention to her thoughtful, almost confrontational gaze. The textured brushstrokes and rich, earthy palette give the piece a tactile depth and painterly energy that differentiates it from the smooth subtlety of the original. Her expression, simultaneously vulnerable and strong, invites the viewer into a quiet moment of introspection. The work pays homage to a timeless classic while asserting a distinct and personal voice.

## Artwork Renamings ##

I'm always trying to get better as an artist. One of the things I realize I need to get better at is titles. I need to be more objective with them, so they are not only in context for my own understanding, but they also need to ADD something to the narrative or the painting.

So I have decided to change some titles of existing paintings. They are:

  * [Embrace](/artwork/final-embrace) -> [Final Embrace](/artwork/final-embrace)
  * [Young Money](/artwork/corporate-contempt) -> [Corporate Contempt](/artwork/corporate-contempt)
  * [Snowfall](/artwork/dying-in-a-snowfall) -> [Dying in a Snowfall](/artwork/dying-in-a-snowfall)
  * [Sailing Away Schoon](/artwork/sailing-away) -> [Sailing Away](/artwork/sailing-away)

Corporate Contempt can also be referred to Pending Trial.

## More Exhibits Coming ##

I’m thrilled to share that I have two more major exhibitions coming up this year — including juried group shows and special receptions — with more details to come soon. Even more exciting, I’m currently in talks to host what would be my very first solo exhibition.

This is a meaningful milestone in my journey as an artist, and I’m incredibly grateful for the continued support. Stay tuned — I can’t wait to share what’s next.
