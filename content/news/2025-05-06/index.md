Too much is happening for me to stick with a quarterly newsletter, so I'm switching back to monthly, as needed. We have a big flash sale, a big showpiece painting released, exhibit announcements, and a new location. First things first...

## Flash Sale ##

I need to order a supply of prints to have on-hand for some upcoming shows. On top of now testing a new option adding handwritten signing to any limited reproductions, now is the perfect time for this flash sale.

Now until **May 10th**, any limited reproduction orders will be freely upgraded to include a handwritten signing on the back. Please use code '**FREESIGN**' so I know if you want your order to be included. It will require a little bit more processing time until I ship out your order.

## New Show Piece Completed ##

I set out to specifically paint something dramatic and eye catching in watercolor. That painting is **[In The Dark](/artwork/in-the-dark)**.

## I'm headed to Springfield Museum of Art ##

**[Avalanche Lilies](/artwork/avalanche-lilies)** has been accepted in to the 2025 Ohio Watercolor Society exhibit, at Springfield Museum of Art. That shoe is starting on September 20th. I am honored to have been chosen to have my work displayed in this exhibit and this is a big deal for me. If you're in South West or Central Ohio, be sure to check the exhibit out!

## Where was I for the North Canton May Show? ##

Honestly, I didn't submit any work. On top of I had other responsibilities to not allow me to drop off the paintings for the jury process in time, I was also not aware that the exhibit was that of a big deal. Someone recently let me know that it was a big deal locally, and I will be sure to take submitting work more seriously. Next year!


## New Location ##

Finally, I have a new location. Many of you in Canton heard about Patina Arts Centre closing. I and some other artists decided to move out shortly before Patina decided and announce it closed. And while I'm excited for the grand opening of Second April Studios taking over the space, you can now find my studio space next door at Kolp's Attic. I will only be publicly there during First Fridays and appointments only. You can walk to my space either directly through Second April's 2nd floor, or through the Kolp's Attic entrances.

## Newsletter Winner ##

I know my commitment for the newsletter winners states it's only every quarter, but I'm going to select another one for this newsletter. Who's going to complain about more chances to win?

The winner is...

**Paul M. from Winnetka, IL**

An email to the winner has separately been sent out to claim their prize.
