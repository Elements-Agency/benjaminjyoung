The last month has been prepping mainly for the biggest sale I will do, celebrating both the holidays and one year of painting. The only exhibit I have going on right now is the closing reception for the Patina Resident Artist Showcase. However, I have a plethora of upcoming exhibits I am spamming to apply to. My only problem right now is my limitation of original paintings I have left to apply with to exhibits.

As for paintings completed, I just have two. One done not as a serious piece, but more for decoration, [Christmas Stocking](/artwork/christmas-stocking). The other, one of my favorites painted so far, [Okay Now](/artwork/okay-now).
