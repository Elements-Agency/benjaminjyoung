I have decided to change up how I do my newsletters, starting as of now. Instead of a monthly release, I will be sending out something everything months instead. This will give me the time I need to work on larger paintings and not be so rushed every month. I can cram more content, of what shows, painting releases, and other happenings in to one spot, so it's more entertaining to read.

## Let's begin with showcasing what paintings have been completed in the last month... ##

I completed one watercolor ([Avalanche Lilies](/artwork/avalanche-lilies)) and one oil ([Embrace](/artwork/embrace)) paintings, both correlated with each other in someway. In the next quarter, I hope to paint the other side of Embrace, and will continue on with some of my narratives. As I slowly build out my own story in artwork, you'll start to see subjects interconnecting.

## So what have I been up to?... ##

That's a good question. Quite a lot, and more coming soon:

  * Starting January 10th, you can see [One Last Walk With Izzy](/artwork/one-last-walk-with-izzy) featured at [Summit Art's FRESH Exhibit](https://www.facebook.com/events/1760040301514562).
  * Several artworks of mine were featured in Patina Art Center's Resident Artist Showcase.
  * The [1st Annual ActLoCLE Juried Art Exhibition](https://www.actlocle.org/firstexhibition/) has wrapped up, with featured [Howard's Hills](/artwork/howards-hills).
  * The [Paul Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org) wrapped up, which featured both [Massillon #52](/artwork/massillon-52) and [Massillon Helmet](/artwork/massillon-helmet).
  * The original for [The Artist's Assistant](/artwork/the-artists-assistant/) has been sold.
  * I have four possible other exhibits coming up in the next few months.

I am hoping to spam art exhibits this year. It's just a matter of having enough originals to submit with.
