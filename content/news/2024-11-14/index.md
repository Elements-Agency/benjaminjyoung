This last month has been busy gearing up for the holiday season, filled with exhibit receptions, more exhibits, and dealing with life. I wrapped up the [Rod Meadow's Art Exhibit](https://www.facebook.com/people/Rod-Meadows-Canton-Art-Call/100083858452065/) with their reception, attended both the [Paul Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org) and [Stark County Artists Exhibit](https://www.massillonmuseum.org/) receptions, and currently now having my artwork featured in the Patina Resident Artist Showcase, and was also announced to be included in the [1st Annual ActLoCLE Juried Art Exhibition](https://www.actlocle.org/firstexhibition/). So it's been a busy month of stepping outside of my art studio at Patina.

I also had two minor paintings completed, that are apart of my [watercolor sketch collection](collections/watercolor-sketches). More artwork will be coming to completion soon.

The other big piece of news, is I am now coming up on the 1 year anniversary of starting painting. I know that can be surprising to some of you to believe I have only been painting for a year! For me it's surprising it's been a year already! However, to help celebrate that anniversary, I'm having my biggest sales yet. **50% OFF all originals!** Now until the end of the year. Just use the discount code **DEC20ANNIVERSARY** at checkout. This will help support me in continuing to paint and set aside more time to keep up with my developing craft. I would like to thank all my supporters, collectors, and buyers for this amazing past year. Thank you!
