To be honest, I have been dreading writing this email. I know some of you were left with a cliffhanger in October’s email, and I was hoping by now to have a definitive answer to “Do I have cancer?”

<!--more-->

It doesn’t always work out like that, and while I can’t say for certain I do have cancer, after the biopsy results are back and molecular testing, it’s a very high likelihood I do. It sounds like I’m going in to surgery in December to have it removed and run pathology on it for that definitive answer. It all ironically goes with a dark joke I keep to myself, how, “I hate Decembers.” There will be several paintings in the future about different Decembers I have experienced, to expand on this saying, and the month is a pivotal element of my narrative for many reasons.

However, it’s really nothing to fret over. In my opinion, Thyroid cancer I believe, is a more manageable type of cancer. If it is cancer, and pardon my French, I’m going to kick cancer’s ass. I’m too stubborn otherwise to let this take me down.

I also have several other great things to look forward to in this upcoming December, and I, of course, will go over that news along with what’s been happening in the last month.

## “Cold Decembers” ##

In December, I’m excited to have a solo exhibit at Brewtifully in North Canton. The opening reception will be on December 6th, Saturday, from 3 pm to 5 pm. The artwork will be up for the rest of the month of December.

## “In The Dark” Receives Awards ##

The Rod Meadow Canton Art Call has ended, and so the award reception took place. My watercolor painting, In The Dark, received both the 3rd Place People’s Choice Award but also the 2nd Place Judges Award.

The watercolor painting I have been slowly working on for the last few months, I wrapped up this past week. It’s a little looser than my other work, but it allowed me to be a bit more expressive with my style.

## Skipping December’s Newsletter ##

I have decided to skip December’s newsletter for a number of reasons. Mainly to spend more time with family. I’m sure you can all understand. Because of that, I will be selecting two winners for this month’s newsletter to make up for it.

And the winners are…

  * **Marisol H.** from Cottonwood, Arizona
  * **Franklin D.** from Roanoke, Virginia


I have separately sent emails to these winners to get their choice of a limited reproduction and where to ship them to. So if your name is above, be on the lookout for another email.
