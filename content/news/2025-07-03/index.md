## ~~Spring~~ Summer Cleaning Sale ##

There are still a few original paintings available in my Summer Cleaning Sale — and they’re 50% off while they last! This is a rare chance to own an original piece at a steep discount, as I make room for new work coming later this season. If you’ve had your eye on something, now’s the time to take another look before these remaining pieces find their homes.

## Massillon Public Library Display ##

My small exhibit at [Massillon Public Library](https://www.massillonlibrary.org) has concluded. It was well received.

{{< img span="image fit" src="masslib.jpg" alt="Massillon Public Library Display" title="Massillon Public Library Display" >}}

As I get more comfortable providing the full contexts of my narrative paintings, this display will include descriptions with much more upfront and transparent explanations. I lived in Massillon for five years and a lot of my current and future pieces are of my time in Massillon. I highly recommend to check it out, if you are in North East Ohio.


## Upcoming Exhibits ##

I still have the [2025 Ohio Watercolor Society exhibit](https://www.ohiowatercolorsociety.org/watercolor-ohio-2025), at [Springfield Museum of Art](https://www.springfieldart.net) coming in September. Stay tuned for more upcoming shows.
