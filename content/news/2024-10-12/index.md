This past month has been busy. Too much to do, too little time. I have not had as much time to paint as I wanted, but at least the other amounts of time not painting were used to sell some of my artwork.

<!--more-->

My favorite painting completed this past month was [Howard's Hills](/artwork/howards-hills/). Inspired by the landscape and old deteriorating farmhouses I grew up around. The man modeled after my father, hobbling around his estate. The style, which is quite natural to me, is very heavily Andrew Wyeth inspired.

I also setup a tent at the Massillon Community Art Council's - Artoberfest event.
