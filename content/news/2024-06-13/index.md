I'm currently playing catch up with writing newsletters and showing off my painting releases. I've been busying getting ready as a new artist and investing a lot of time in not only painting, but also marketing and building my exposure. So this month is going to include quite a lot of new paintings to divulge through.

I also have moved in to [Patina Art Centre](http://patinaartscentre.com/) as a resident artist. I have some artwork hanging up there, so feel free to go visit during their business hours and you can find me on the second floor.

First off, let's start off with the last month of new paintings:
