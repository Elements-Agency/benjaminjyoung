The end of summer is fast approaching, and I've been busy as ever with my art-related activities. I had to skip last month's newsletter, just because it's been a little overwhelming. There's been some key obvious reasons of what I have been up to, even though I have not been able to complete as much work as I have desired.

The first big thing... The completion of what I consider my first "masterpiece", [Hallelujah](/artwork/hallelujah/). I will let the painting speak for it's self:

I was caught on last First Friday, while supporting the [Patina Arts Centre First Fundraiser](https://www.facebook.com/events/869821251632238/), live painting this oil artwork.

On top of that, I have been getting ready for my first exhibit at [Massillon Museum](https://www.massillonmuseum.org). The **[Paul Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org)** is currently on until January, so you can stop by and check it out.
