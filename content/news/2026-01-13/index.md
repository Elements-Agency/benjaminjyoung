description: I’m introducing a new series of 7x5in winter watercolor warm-ups, inspired by a recent reference-gathering trip to Delaware, and sharing a successful recap of my Brewtifully exhibit.

Hello everyone,

I hope your new year is off to a peaceful start. January has brought a quiet, reflective energy to my studio, and I’m excited to share some new work, inspiration from recent travels, and important personal updates with you all.

## New Miniatures: The Winter Series ##

Lately, I’ve been starting my mornings with small-scale explorations to capture the stark beauty of the season. I’m thrilled to introduce the first two pieces of this series: "Winter Barn 1" and "Winter Birch 1."

These 7x5in watercolors serve as my daily warm-ups. They allow me to experiment with light and texture on a smaller canvas, and I plan to continue this series throughout the winter months. There is something incredibly meditative about the contrast of deep shadows against the winter snow.

## Inspiration from the Coast: Delaware Trip ##

I recently returned from a trip to Delaware, and while the weather was brisk, the landscape was absolutely captivating. I spent a great deal of time exploring the shoreline and the quiet winter fields, coming back with a massive slew of new reference photos. Including from driving through the Mountains on our trip there and from.

The way the low winter sun hits the dunes and the dormant marshes is unlike any other time of year. I’m looking forward to translating these icy blues and muted gold tones onto paper in the coming months.

## Exhibition & Studio Updates ##

### Brewtifully Recap ###

A huge thank you to everyone who stopped by my December exhibit at Brewtifully. It was a joy to see so many familiar faces and share my work in such a vibrant community space. The support I felt during that show was the perfect way to wrap up the year.

### A New Rhythm for First Fridays ###

I have decided to shift how I handle my studio openings. I will no longer be opening for every First Friday. Instead, I’ll be opening the studio selectively a few times a month.

This change is important to me because it provides the dedicated time needed to curate more cohesive, intentional displays for you to experience. I’ll be sharing the date for my next opening in a future update—stay tuned!

## In the Works: Behind the Scenes ##

My easel is currently full of several larger pieces that explore the interplay of light and memory. Here is a quick look at what’s currently in progress:

## A Personal Update ##

{{< preview style="right" painting="/story/howards-hills/" full="true" caption="My father in Howard's Hills" >}}

Life has a way of shifting our plans. My scheduled surgery for January has been pushed back to February. While the wait is a bit taxing, it has given me a few more weeks of mobility in the studio.

On a much heavier note, I have some difficult family news. My father, featured in my piece "Howard's Hills", has recently been diagnosed with cancer. He will begin radiation immediately. It is a challenging time for us, and I appreciate your kindness and thoughts as we navigate this journey together. Especially dealing with the anxiety that I await for surgery and for an answer if I myself cancer.
