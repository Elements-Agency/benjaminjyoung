## Benjamin J. Young ##

{{< img span="image right" class="rounded" src="/images/ben-small.webp" alt="Photo of Benjamin J. Young" title="Ben Young" >}}

I began painting in December 2023, with no formal background in art beyond an eighth-grade class. Since then, I’ve primarily worked in watercolor, occasionally exploring oil, with a focus on narrative realism. My approach is rooted in expressing emotion first and capturing values second—if a painting evokes a genuine emotional response in someone, then I consider it a success.

Interestingly, many viewers have compared my style to that of Andrew Wyeth, a connection I wasn’t initially aware of until it was pointed out to me. After exploring his work, I realized the resemblance is purely intuitive—an organic outcome of my own developing expression and technique. Much of my work is drawn from personal experience, emotion, and past trauma. Through this visual storytelling, I aim to create work that resonates with others on a deeply human level.

### Artist Story ###

My featured work is a deeply personal narration of my own life—told not through words, but through vivid imagery, emotional gestures, and atmosphere. Each painting feels like a chapter, capturing moments of memory, solitude, resilience, and quiet beauty. I invite viewers into an inner world shaped by personal experience—sometimes raw, sometimes tender, but always honest. Whether it’s a solitary figure in motion or a still landscape bathed in silence, my art doesn’t just aim to depict life—it strives to reveal the emotional undercurrents of my own. In sharing my story, I hope others can find a piece of theirs within it.
