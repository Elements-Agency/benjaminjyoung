Ben Young is a contemporary fine artist originally from Appalachia, Ohio, now working out of Canton. Though he began painting in watercolor and oil less than two years ago, his work has quickly gained attention for its emotional depth and storytelling. Each piece is a personal narrative, rooted in lived experience and expressed through a sensitive, evocative style. His paintings resonate with collectors drawn to authenticity, vulnerability, and a fresh, emerging voice in American art.
