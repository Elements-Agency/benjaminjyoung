My main bodies of artwork make up my life story. They are split in six current sections or "eras". I have most works that I have not started, already planned out. I know exactly how I want them to look and how I want them to feel. Since after all, it is my life and memory.

## Childhood Era ##
_1990 - 2007_

It will be a number of years until I start painting anything in this era. Filled with nostalgia and childhood topics.

## The Dark Era ##
_2009 - 2011_

A segment of time I have always referred to as the dark part of my life. It was a bleak moment of life, while I was still young in adulthood. Dealing with situations forced on me and my lifetime plans drastically changing several times, with me having to adapt for survival.

This era focuses on the short amount of time of becoming a young parent, becoming engaged, and facing threatening loss of both of those topics. It was not a happy time for me.

No current works in this era that are planned have been painted. Future titles of this era will include:
  * Unexpected
  * Unfaithful
  * Electrifying

## The Hart's Desire ##
_2011 - 2013_

This era starts with meeting my second fiancee. Following the relation as it builds, as we both grow together. Her pulling me out of my "Dark Era" and to learn to become the man I am now, living life the best I can make of it.

No current works in this era are completed yet. Future titles of this era will include:
  * Show Me What I'm Looking For
  * Shared Words
  * Hot Spring
  * Adopting Izzy
  * Expecting
  * Carol of the Bells
  * The Call (December 20th, 2013)
  * Goodbye (December 20th, 2013)
  * Broken (December 21st, 2013)

## Purgatory Era ##
_2014 - 2018_

After the night of my life's biggest loss, this era begins. This era is mainly uneventful, myself living in a emotional purgatory and suppression. 

No current works in this era are completed yet. Future titles of this era will include:
  * Going to Voicemail
  * Office Christmas Party
  * Lapels and Pens
  * People Watching

## Second Hartbeat Era ##
_2018 - 2020_

This era follows the events that took place that made me seek healing from trauma.
