My main bodies of artwork make up my life story. They are split in six current sections or "eras". I have most works that I have not started, already planned out. Since after all, it is my life and memory.

## Childhood Era ##
_1990 - 2007_

It will be a number of years until I start painting to paint this era.

## The Dark Era ##
_2009 - 2011_

A segment of time I have always referred to as the dark part of my life. It was a bleak moment of life, while I was still young in adulthood. Dealing with situations forced on me and my lifetime plans drastically changing, with me having to adapt to survive.

This era focuses on the short amount of time of becoming a young parent, becoming engaged, and facing threatening loss of both of those topics. It was not a happy time for me.

No current works in this era that are planned have been painted. Future titles of this era will include:
  * Unexpected
  * Unfaithful
  * Electrifying

## The Hart's Desire ##
_2012 - 2013_

This era starts with meeting my second fiancee. Following the relation as it builds, and we both grow together. Her pulling me out of my "Dark Era" and to learn to become who I am now, living life the best I can make of it. The story will end in tragedy and will go on to destroy me emotionally and mentally.

No current works in this era are completed yet. Future titles of this era will include:
  * First Glance
  * Shared Words
  * Hot Spring
  * Izzy
  * Expecting
  * Goodbye
  * Broken

## Purgatory Era ##
_2014 - 2017_

After the night of my life's biggest loss, this era begins. This era is mainly uneventful, myself living in a emotional purgatory and suppression. 

No current works in this era are completed yet. Future titles of this era will include:
  * Office Christmas Party
  * Lapels and Pens
  * People Watching

## Second Hartbeat Era ##
_2018 - 2020_

This era follows the events that took place that made me seek healing from trauma.
