description: My main bodies of work are laid out in my life's story.
---

While each painting objectively should stand on it's own, my main focus of artworks makes up my life story. There is a continued narrative among each iteration. As a group, they are split into six current sections or "eras". Most work that has not started is already planned out. I know exactly how I want them to look and how I want them to feel. After all, it is my life and memory.

Follow the story of my life story in these paintings, grouped by their respected eras:

## Childhood Era ##
_1990 - 2008_

It will be several years before I start painting anything in this era. Filled with nostalgia and childhood topics.

## The Dark Era ##
_2008 - 2011_

A segment of time I have always referred to as the dark part of my life. It was a bleak moment of life, while I was still young in adulthood. Dealing with situations forced on me and my lifetime plans drastically changed several times, with me having to adapt for survival.

This era focuses on the short amount of time of becoming a young parent, becoming engaged, and facing the loss of both of those topics. It was not a happy time for me.

No current works in this era that are planned have been painted. Future titles of this era will include:
  * **Unexpected**
  * **Unfaithful**
  * **Electrifying**

## The Hart's Desire ##
_2011 - 2013_

This era starts with meeting my second fiancee. Following the relationship as it builds, as we both grow together. Herself dragging me out of my "Dark Era‚Äù with loving support and to guiding me to become the man I am now, living life the best I can make of it.
