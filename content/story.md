The featured artwork collectively traces a narrative arc drawn from my lived experiences. Each piece represents a distinct moment, embodying personal themes of adversity, resilience, connection, and growth. When presented in chronological order, these works unfold as a visual autobiography, allowing the viewer to witness the progression of events as they occurred in my life. Together, they form a cohesive body of work that reflects not only individual memories, but also the broader evolution of my artistic and personal journey.

While each painting objectively should stand on it's own, my main focus of artworks makes up my life story. There is a continued narrative among each iteration. As a group, they are split into six current sections or "eras", but only five are started. Most work that has not started is already planned out. I know exactly how I want them to look and how I want them to feel. After all, it is my life and memory.

## Childhood Era ##
_1990 - 2008_

It will be several years before I start painting anything in this era. Filled with nostalgia and childhood topics. As well as some other darker topics of childhood.

* **Shower Time** - The scene of my first loss.
* **Too Loud** - A small boy being pummeled violently for being too loud, while playing outside with other children.

* **Serenity** - A small boy sits on top of a snowy hill, discovering a peace later used in meditation.


## The Dark Era ##
_2008 - 2011_

A segment of time I have always referred to as the dark part of my life. It was a bleak moment of life, while I was still young in adulthood. Dealing with situations forced on me and my lifetime plans drastically changed several times, with me having to adapt for survival. The era expands on topics of betrayal and anger.

This era focuses on the short amount of time of becoming a young parent, becoming [engaged](/tags/number-one), and facing the loss of both of those topics. It was not a happy time for me.

No current works in this era that are planned have been painted. Future titles of this era will include:
  * **Unexpected**
  * **Unfaithful** - Painting 2 of 3 of [The Dark Trio](/collections/the-dark-trio),
  * **Electrifying**

## The Hart's Desire Era ##
_2011 - 2013_

This era starts with meeting my [second fiancee](/tags/number-two). Following the relationship as it builds, as we both grow together. Herself dragging me out of my previous "Dark Era‚Äù with loving support and to guiding me to become the man I am now, living life the best I can make of it. The era expands of topics of love, loss, and the beginnings of trauma.

No current works in this era are completed yet. I'm still preparing myself for it. This era is both the most amazing point of my life and the most devastating to me.

## Purgatory Era ##
_2014 - 2018_

After the night of my life's [largest loss](/tags/number-two), this era begins. This era is mainly uneventful, myself living in emotional purgatory and suppression. Six years of living through the effects of devastating trauma. The era expands on topics of living life on autopilot, and being passive to the atrocities occurring around one's self.

No current works in this era have been completed yet.

## Second Hartbeat Era ##
_2018 - 2020_

This era follows the events that took place that lead me to seek healing my traumas. It follows my journey to finally start to break free of traumatic emotional suppression, and coming back to who I was once again. The era expands on topics of vulnerability, love, betrayal, deceit, and overwhelming confrontation to previously suppressed emotions.

The paintings are intentionally mute of color and dark in this era, and saturation and lightness starts to be introduced as the series progress, as the willingness to live life comes back to me. The series will end in explosions of vibrant color.

## Escaping Era ##
_2020 - 2023_

This era follows me trying to escape the painful memories of my home and seek out peace. Running into difficulties that would lead me back to art while being stuck in a near frozen and frozen hellhole. The era expands over a lot of topics of wanderlust, regret, and shifting through the consequences of loss.

The paintings in this era are meant to be vibrant and colorful, as I am finally alive again, after breaking free of traumatic emotional suppression.

The colorfulness is a little more dull, but still present in this era, to reflect the rolling theme.
