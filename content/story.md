description: My main bodies of work are laid out in my life's story.
---

While each painting objectively should stand on it's own, my main focus of artworks makes up my life story. There is a continued narrative among each iteration. As a group, they are split into six current sections or "eras". Most work that has not started is already planned out. I know exactly how I want them to look and how I want them to feel. After all, it is my life and memory.

## Childhood Era ##
_1990 - 2008_

It will be several years before I start painting anything in this era. Filled with nostalgia and childhood topics. As well as some other darker topics of childhood.

* **Shower Time** - The scene of my first loss.
* **Too Loud** - A small boy being pummeled violently for being too loud, while playing outside with other children.
* **Black Sheep** - The effects of an abuser can have making a child feel isolated and unloved from the world.

* **Appalachian Forrest** - My safe place as a child.
* **Serenity** - A small boy sits on top of a snowy hill, discovering a peace later used in meditation.


## The Dark Era ##
_2008 - 2011_

A segment of time I have always referred to as the dark part of my life. It was a bleak moment of life, while I was still young in adulthood. Dealing with situations forced on me and my lifetime plans drastically changed several times, with me having to adapt for survival. The era expands on topics of betrayal and anger.

This era focuses on the short amount of time of becoming a young parent, becoming [engaged](/tags/number-one), and facing the loss of both of those topics. It was not a happy time for me.

No current works in this era that are planned have been painted. Future titles of this era will include:
  * **Unexpected**
  * üñåÔ∏è **Unfaithful** - Painting 2 of 3 of [The Dark Trio](/collections/the-dark-trio),
  * **Electrifying**

## The Hart's Desire Era ##
_2011 - 2013_

This era starts with meeting my [second fiancee](/tags/number-two). Following the relationship as it builds, as we both grow together. Herself dragging me out of my "Dark Era‚Äù with loving support and to guiding me to become the man I am now, living life the best I can make of it. The era expands of topics of love, loss, and the beginnings of trauma.

No current works in this era are completed yet. I'm still preparing myself for it. This era is both the most amazing point of my life and the most devastating to me. Future titles of this era will include:

## Purgatory Era ##
_2014 - 2018_

After the night of my life's [largest loss](/tags/number-two), this era begins. This era is mainly uneventful, myself living in emotional purgatory and suppression. Six years of living through the effects of devastating trauma. The era expands on topics of living life on autopilot, and being passive to the atrocities occurring around one's self.

This era follows the events that took place that lead me to seek healing my traumas. It follows my journey to finally start to break free of traumatic emotional suppression, and coming back to who I was once again. The era expands on topics of vulnerability, love, betrayal, deceit, and overwhelming confrontation to previously suppressed emotions.
