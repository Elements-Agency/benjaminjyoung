<p>Because in the modern art world, traditional techniques and styles are often overlooked, galleries play a crucial role in supporting and promoting artists who work within these frameworks. This list aims to highlight those galleries that are worth it for traditional artists to apply for their exhibits. Grades here are not necessarily overall reflective of the galleries themselves, but on the time worthiness of applying to their exhibits as a traditional artist. There are several galleries here I actually really enjoy be involved with, with a lower grade, but it's more with an intent of fun than finding a good fit for my traditional are or the intent of sales.</p>

<p>"Contemporary art" in this context is not time period definitive, as all art pieces in these exhibits are contemporary in release. Instead, I use "contemporary" and "traditional" more with the intent of styles.</p>
