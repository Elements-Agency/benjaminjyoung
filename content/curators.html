    <p>
        Curators and Art Gallery Owners, my name is <strong>Ben Young</strong>, and I’m an emerging artist creating emotionally driven narrative paintings that reflect themes of solitude, memory, and the quiet resilience of the human experience.
        My work blends atmosphere and storytelling in a way that invites viewers into deeply personal yet universally resonant moments.
        Most are astounded by a lot of my work is watercolor, as I use it in a way that is more akin to oil painting, with layers of glazes and rich textures.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m currently seeking opportunities to exhibit my work in galleries that value contemporary figurative art with a strong emotional core.
        With a growing collector base and increasing interest in my pieces, I’m eager to continue building meaningful connections within the art community and share my work with broader audiences.

    <h2>Why You Should Book Me At Your Gallery?</h2>
    <p>
        {{< img span="image right" class="rounded" src="/images/ben-small.webp" alt="Photo of Benjamin J. Young" title="Ben Young" >}}
        My art has a <a href="/curators/analysis">proven track record of sales</a>, both online and in-person, with a steadily growing collector base that spans various demographics.
        Within less than two years of even beginning to paint, I have figured out a way to consistently sell my work online, and I have a strong understanding of how to market my art to the right audiences.
        <br><br>
        Now I'm hoping to expand my reach through gallery exhibitions, where I can connect with original art collectors and art enthusiasts in a more personal way.
        On the information below, you will find a detailed analysis of my sales record and collector demographics, which may be useful in understanding the reach and resonance of my art.
        Please feel free to reach out—I look forward to the possibility of working together.

    <h2>Ideal Exhibit Locations</h2>
    <p>
        I am open to exhibiting in galleries across the United States, with a preference for locations that have a strong appreciation for contemporary figurative art and narrative-driven pieces.
        Based on my <a href="/curators/analysis">sales analysis</a>, I have identified the states where my work has resonated particularly well with collectors.
        These states include the mid-appalachian states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Maryland.
        Outside of that geographical region, lower-peninsula Michigan for some unknown reason also has a strong interest in my work.
    </p>

    <h2>Portfolio Available for Exhibit</h2>
    <p>
        I have 63 completed original works in my portfolio, but as my skills improve, I'm selective to what I continue to show.
        Here are the originals I have left for sale, that I deem worthy of exhibiting:

        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/howards-hills/" >}}

        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/final-embrace/" >}}

        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/standoff/" >}}
    {{< row-end >}}

    <p>
        Since my more popular pieces where the originals have sold, I am able to provide these works for exhibit in high quality reproductions.
        If that's acceptable to the gallery's rules:
    </p>

    {{< row-start >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/one-last-walk-with-izzy/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/okay-now/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/the-artists-assistant/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/defeat/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/erie-rock-ii/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/sailing-away/" >}}
        {{< preview col="3" painting="/artwork/silent-reflections/" >}}
    {{< row-end >}}

    <p>
        I appreciate your consideration and would welcome the opportunity to exhibit my artwork in your gallery.
        I am confident that my pieces would resonate with a well selected audience, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on a successful and engaging exhibitions.
