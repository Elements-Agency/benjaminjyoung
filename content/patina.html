<p>
    I'm <strong>Ben Young</strong>, a contemporary artist in Canton Ohio.
    I mainly focus on painting landscapes, especially with some narrative aspects in them.
    You'll occasionally see some still life by me, to practice certain techniques or adjust my methods.
    I've only been painting since December 2023, so I'm still learning and refining my style and technique.
    As I've been painting more and more, I believe my style is focusing more in to realism (influenced by elements of impressionism) with an critical focus on playing with the environment lighting.
