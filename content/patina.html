<p>
    I'm <strong><a href="/about#main">Ben Young</a></strong>, a contemporary artist in Canton Ohio.
    I mainly focus on painting <a href="/categories/landscape/#main">landscapes</a>, especially with some <a href="/categories/narrative/#main">narrative aspects</a> in them.
    You'll occasionally see some <a href="/categories/still-life/#main">still life</a> by me, to practice certain techniques or adjust my methods.
    Mainly painting with <a href="/mediums/oil/#main">oil</a> and <a href="/mediums/watercolor/#main">watercolor</a> paint.
    I've only been painting since December 2023, so I'm still learning and refining my style and technique.
    As I've been painting more and more, I believe my style is focusing more in to <a href="/categories/realism/#main">realism</a> (influenced by elements of <a href="/categories/impressionism/#main">impressionism</a>) with an critical focus on playing with the environment lighting.
