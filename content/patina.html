<p>
    I'm <strong><a href="/about">Ben Young</a></strong>, a contemporary artist in Canton Ohio.
    I mainly focus on painting <a href="/categories/landscape/">landscapes</a>, especially with some <a href="/categories/narrative/">narrative aspects</a> in them.
    You'll occasionally see some <a href="/categories/still-life/">still life</a> by me, to practice certain techniques or adjust my methods.
    Mainly painting with <a href="/mediums/oil/">oil</a> and <a href="/mediums/watercolo/r">watercolor</a> paint.
    I've only been painting since December 2023, so I'm still learning and refining my style and technique.
    As I've been painting more and more, I believe my style is focusing more in to <a href="/categories/realism/">realism</a> (influenced by elements of <a href="/categories/impressionism/">impressionism</a>) with an critical focus on playing with the environment lighting.
