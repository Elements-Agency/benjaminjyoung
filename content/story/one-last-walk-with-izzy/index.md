title: One Last Walk With Izzy
subtitle: Izzy, My Faithful Border Collie Companion
description: One Last Walk With Izzy captures the walk I wish I’d had with my rescued Border Collie, Izzy, in her final days. Adopted alongside my late fiancée, Andrea, Izzy overcame a painful past to become my constant companion after Andrea’s passing. In her youth, she roamed the rolling hills of Southeast Ohio by my side, but by the time I was healthy enough to walk them again, she had grown too old. This painting is my way of giving us that one last walk we never got to take.

There are some walks we get to take — and some that live only in the quiet corners of our hearts. **One Last Walk With Izzy** is one of those moments I never had, but always wished for.

<!--more-->

Izzy came into my life alongside my late fiancée, Andrea. She was a rescued Border Collie, carrying the weight of scars — both the ones you could see, and the ones you couldn’t. She had been abused before we found her, devocalized by a previous owner, and at first, she was afraid of me. She clung to Andrea for comfort, keeping her distance from my presence.

The night Andrea died, I came home shattered and hollow. It was that night, for the first time, that Izzy quietly walked over and laid her head on my lap. No words could have passed between us, but in that moment, we became the only family we had left of the life Andrea and I had dreamed of. From then on, Izzy never left my side.

Through the years, she was my shadow — on every trail, every errand, every quiet evening. When COVID struck and I found myself working from home, my days as a software engineer were spent with Izzy at my feet. I had finally regained the strength to be active again, but by then, she had grown too old, too fragile. The hills we once roamed together in Southeast Ohio were no longer hers to conquer.

This painting is not a memory, but a wish. A wish for one last golden afternoon, walking side by side through the rolling Appalachia hills. A wish for one final chance to feel the sun on our backs and the earth under our feet, to watch her ears catch the wind, and to know she was still keeping pace beside me.

I never had that walk — so I painted it.
