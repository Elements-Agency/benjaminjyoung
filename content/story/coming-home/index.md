**Coming Home** holds a quiet, aching tenderness - Izzy poised in the tall, sun-bleached grass, ears lifted in hope, carries a longing that reaches across the empty space between it and me sitting on the porch ahead of her.

In this summer-lit moment, the painting holds the quiet story of how Izzy and I learned to find our way to one another after loss reshaped our world. When her trusted person—my fiancée—passed away, Izzy carried her grief in the same way I carried mine: cautiously, quietly, unsure of where to place it. For a long time, she kept her distance, watching me from the edges of the room or the far side of the field, as if waiting to understand the shape of this new life we hadn’t asked for. But slowly, day by day, she began to draw closer, out of necessity for each other. This painting captures the tender turning point of that journey: the moment she chose to close the gap, to trust again, and to let the warmth of a summer afternoon soften what had been hardened by loss. It’s the story of how two hearts, both broken in the same place, learned to heal together.
