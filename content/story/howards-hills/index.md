description: In Corporate Contempt, artist Ben Young invites the viewer into a moment of profound stillness and internal questioning. A lone figure stands motionless in a modern office, his back to us, bathed in muted light filtering through towering glass windows. The setting is familiar—an executive suite high above a city—but the emotional undercurrent is anything but routine.
author: Benjamin J. Young

In ___Howard’s Hills___, **Ben Young** returns home—not only in geography, but in heart. Set in the quiet hills of Appalachian Ohio where the artist was raised, the painting captures a deeply personal and intimate moment: the artist’s elderly father making his way across the familiar terrain of their shared past. It’s not just a portrait of landscape—it’s a portrait of legacy.

The golden-brown hills roll gently beneath a winter sky, their texture rich with the passage of seasons and generations. At the center, a humble white farmhouse anchors the composition, weathered but proud, standing as both shelter and symbol. In the foreground, a solitary figure walks with slow, deliberate steps—a visual echo of time moving forward, but always carrying memory.

This painting is a meditation on aging, place, and familial connection. Young’s brushwork doesn’t just depict the hills—he honors them. Every stroke evokes the feeling of wind over fields, the sound of boots through dormant grass, the quiet strength of a father who still walks the land he once ran.

For collectors, Howard’s Hills offers more than visual beauty—it holds emotional weight. It invites us to reflect on our own roots, our parents, and the landscapes—physical or emotional—that shaped us. It's a rare work that manages to balance nostalgia with honesty, solitude with warmth, and personal memory with universal recognition.
