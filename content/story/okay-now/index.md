Some portraits don’t just depict a person—they hold a moment. A breath. A lifetime.

**Ben Young’s** ___Okay Now___ is one of those rare works. Rendered in watercolor with aching precision, it captures an elderly woman looking out a window, her eyes filled with memory, reflection, and something unspoken. There’s no flash—just honesty. And in that honesty, we find something universal.

This painting was born from Ben’s years working in a nursing home—where daily interactions became deeply personal. Over time, he grew close to the residents in his care, bearing witness not just to their routines, but to their stories, their decline, and ultimately, their departures.

> “I painted this after saying goodbye to a particular resident I had grown close to,” Ben shares. “I remember their wisdom and strength, sometimes with surrender. And how often, before I would end my day's shift, they’d say something like, ‘Okay Now’ That phrase stuck with me.”

That phrase, “Okay now,” became the anchor for this piece—a soft farewell, filled with farewells and grace.

To collectors, Okay Now is more than a portrait. It’s a meditation on aging and humanity. The subject’s gaze is not toward us, but outward—toward memory, or perhaps the future. She wears time in her skin, in her hands, in the quiet power of her posture. There is no fear here. Only presence.

This is a piece that rewards those who linger. It doesn’t shout—it invites. For collectors who value art that carries meaning and memory, Okay Now offers an emotional depth that lives far beyond the frame.
