Some portraits don’t just depict a person—they hold a moment. A breath. A lifetime.

Okay Now is one of those rare works. Rendered in watercolor with aching precision, it captures an elderly woman looking out a window, her eyes filled with memory, reflection, and something unspoken. There’s no flash—just honesty. And in that honesty, we find something universal.

This painting was born from my years working in a nursing home—where daily interactions became deeply personal. Over time, I grew close to the residents in his care, bearing witness not just to their routines, but to their stories, their decline, and ultimately, their departures.


## From The Pines, To Strasbourg ##
> I knew an old wise woman once. She told me to make my way back to Strasbourg, so I did. From her pine framed window, she bid farewell, “Okay now. I’ll be seeing you.” With her gaze and expression of both endearment and concern, but excitement for me. Looking on in to the day’s sun. This painting perfectly captures those feelings and experiences with my dear old friend.

That phrase, “Okay now,” became the anchor for this piece—a soft farewell, filled with farewells and grace.

To collectors, Okay Now is more than a portrait. It’s a meditation on aging and humanity. The subject’s gaze is not toward us, but outward—toward memory, or perhaps the future. She wears time in her skin, in her hands, in the quiet power of her posture. There is no fear here. Only presence.

This is a piece that rewards those who linger. It doesn’t shout—it invites. For collectors who value art that carries meaning and memory, Okay Now offers an emotional depth that lives far beyond the frame.
