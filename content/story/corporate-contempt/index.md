title: Corporate Contempt
subtitle: The Stillness Before the Exit
description: In Corporate Contempt, artist Ben Young invites the viewer into a moment of profound stillness and internal questioning. A lone figure stands motionless in a modern office, his back to us, bathed in muted light filtering through towering glass windows. The setting is familiar—an executive suite high above a city—but the emotional undercurrent is anything but routine.

There’s a certain silence that falls in a corporate office when the emails stop, the calls fade, and all that’s left is the hum of fluorescent lights and the weight of your own thoughts.

___Corporate Contempt___ captures that silence. That moment when you stop moving just long enough to ask yourself—Is this it?

This painting was born from my own internal reckoning. The figure stands at a distance from the desk, frozen in a quiet, almost cinematic moment of reflection. The office is modern, efficient, and sterile. Sunlight pours in through floor-to-ceiling windows, but there’s no real warmth—only the stark contrast between light and shadow.

It’s a visual metaphor for the conflict so many of us carry: the illusion of control, the grind of productivity, and the creeping suspicion that we were meant for something more. Something real. Something outside.

I painted Corporate Contempt after dealing with returning to the office post-COVID, wondering how we got there—how our lives became tethered to email chains, endless meetings, and careers that often feel devoid of soul. I’d stared out the window at the trees and long for dirt trails instead of hallways, for rain instead of routine.

This painting is for the moment you ask yourself if you're building a legacy or simply helping someone else build theirs.

It’s not a condemnation—it’s a mirror. And sometimes, it takes a quiet moment in an empty room to realize you’re ready to walk out the door and rediscover your life.
