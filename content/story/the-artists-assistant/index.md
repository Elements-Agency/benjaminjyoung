title: A Portrait of Grief, Loyalty, and Unseen Witnesses
subtitle: The Artist's Assistant
description: At first glance, The Artist’s Assistant appears playful—a cat wearing a watercolor cup like a crown, watching quietly in a sunlit studio. But beneath the charm lies a story of profound loss and quiet companionship. Painted after the tragic loss of his fiancée and daughter in a car accident, this piece features the artist’s cat, Princess, faithfully watching him paint through grief. The childlike drawing in the foreground reflects a lost family, a surviving son, and Izzy the dog—Princess’s late companion. Tender, layered, and deeply personal, this work is a meditation on memory, resilience, and the silent witnesses who help carry us through.

In ___The Artist’s Assistant___, **Ben Young** presents a deceptively whimsical image—a tuxedo cat wearing a watercolor cup as a crown, sitting quietly beside a watercolor block, a tennis ball, and a paintbrush. But behind the soft palette and tender brushwork lies a heartbreakingly personal story. This painting is not about play—it’s about presence, loss, and the quiet roles our companions play in helping us survive the unimaginable.

The subject of the piece is Young’s cat, Princess. She was not just a pet, but a daily witness to his creative process—and, more importantly, to his healing. Painted from life, she is shown sitting faithfully beside him on his living room floor, watching as he painted in watercolor—often refusing to leave his side.

At her feet lies a childlike stick figure drawing: a family, hand in hand—except for two figures dangerously close to the wheels of an approaching car. This is no ordinary sketch. It’s a depiction of Ben’s greatest loss: the death of his fiancée and unborn daughter in a tragic car accident. The remaining figures—the artist himself, his son, and their dog Izzy—are those who survived. Izzy, the dog shown in the drawing, was Princess’s companion—her friend, whose absence she too came to mourn when Izzy passed away from old age.

> “Princess would sit with me whenever I would paint,” Ben says. “She would keep me company, faithfully sitting close by, as I used painting as a medium for healing. I would have a habit of sitting on the floor while doing it, so she could join me.”

This painting captures that moment—when words fall away, and grief is processed not with language, but through quiet rituals: the brush moving on paper, the cat nearby, the memories close.

The Artist’s Assistant reminds us that sometimes, the smallest presences bear witness to the heaviest moments. It is a painting about grief—but also about loyalty, tenderness, and the silent strength of those who stay close when we need them most.
