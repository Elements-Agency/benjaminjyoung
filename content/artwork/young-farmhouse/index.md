progress: Using a watercolor paint set on cold press wood pulp watercolor paper. This artwork took forever to do. Similar to Fry's Tree, the progress stretched out and the skills had developed past of when I started. I had to force myself to complete this one.

This **Young Farmhouse** painting portrays a rustic, rural scene. Dominating the left foreground is a large, dark brown walnut tree, its detailed bark texture suggesting an old and sturdy presence. From one of its branches, a swing with a wooden seat dangles, its ropes hanging limply, waiting for a visitor and adding balance to the painting. Further back, the scene opens to a golden field, which could be a harvested crop, bordered by a dense tree line that marks the edge of a forest. The trees are evergreens, standing tall and dark green against the horizon.

Behind the tree, set in the middle ground, is a quaint brick house with multiple windows, exuding a cozy, lived-in feel. To the house's left, there is a small, white outbuilding with a single red window, that was once a chicken coupe but now acts as a shed. These structures are nestled within a green landscape with patches of darker and lighter shades, indicating the undulating terrain.

The subject and inspiration is that of my [family's 1875 brick farmhouse](https://piketownship.net/our-history/). It was a house I spent a large part of my childhood in, being babysat my by aunt. Even past that, it always stood next to my own home and the center focal point of the frontage to our family's 64 acres of land. The fields and forrest you see backset to the house were the woods I grew up in exploring in my childhood.
