description: The Young Farmhouse is that of my family's orginal farmhouse I grew up next to, built in 1875. It's brickwork and strong foundation built by the very hands of my ancestors have stayed sturdy in it's Ohio clay and slate grounds, that hopefully are carried over in the details of the watercolor brushtrokes I have painted.
