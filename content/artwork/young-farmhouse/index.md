This **Young Farmhouse** painting portrays a rustic, rural scene. Dominating the left foreground is a large, dark brown walnut tree, its detailed bark texture suggesting an old and sturdy presence. From one of its branches, a swing with a wooden seat dangles, its ropes hanging limply, waiting for a visitor.

Behind the tree, set in the middle ground, is a quaint brick house with multiple windows, exuding a cozy, lived-in feel. To the house's left, there is a small, white outbuilding with a single red window, that was once a chicken coupe but now acts as a shed. These structures are nestled within a green landscape with patches of darker and lighter shades, indicating the undulating terrain.

Further back, the scene opens to a golden field, which could be a harvested crop, bordered by a dense tree line that marks the edge of a forest. The trees are evergreens, standing tall and dark green against the horizon.

The sky above is a pale blue, suggesting an overcast day, with the light not quite bright enough to cast strong shadows. I have included various details like the foliage at the base of the tree and the texture of the grass, which add depth and realism to the scene.

The painting has a feeling of tranquility and nostalgia, evoking memories of childhood summers or quiet life in the countryside. The overall style combines elements of realism with a touch of impressionism, seen in the way the grass and foliage are rendered with loose brushwork.

### Inspiration ###

{{< img src="reference.webp" width="200px" height="150px" class="floatright" gallery="progress" alt="Young Farmhouse Reference Photo" title="Reference Photo" link="reference.jpg" >}}

The subject and inspiration is that of my [family's 1875 brick farmhouse](https://piketownship.net/our-history/). It was a house I spent a large part of my childhood in, being babysat my by aunt. Even past that, it always stood next to my own home and the center focal point of the frontage to our family's 64 acres of land. The fields and forrest you see backset to the house were the woods I grew up in exploring in my childhood.

I painted this with [watercolor paint](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Froyal-langnickel-waterclor-paint-set-of-12%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D86329-1009%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=86329-1009) on [watercolor pad paper](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Fcanson-lettering-pad-watercolor%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D09634-1001%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=09634-1001). I used mainly my [Princeton Velvetouch](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Fprinceton-velvetouch-series-3950-synthetic-brushes-blick-exclusive-set-of-4%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D06444-1049%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=06444-1049) long round brush, but occasionally my [Princeton Aqua Elite set](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Fprinceton-aqua-elite-series-4850-synthetic-brushes-set-of-4%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D05468-1049%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=05468-1049) for certain softer features (e.g. the wash).

Here is an visual overview of the progress:

This artwork took forever to do. Similar to [Fry's Tree](/artwork/frys-tree), the progress stretched out and the skills had developed past of when I started. I had to force myself to complete this one.

## About the Artist ##

{{< img class="benprolite" width="150px" height="150px" src="/images/ben-small.webp" alt="Photo of Benjamin J. Young" title="Ben Young" >}}

Ben Young grew up in East Sparta Ohio. His family were the first settlers to the area, back in 1800. His heritage is deeply rooted with the history of the area. Being an artist, it's captures in times like this painting that give Ben's artwork a sense of narrative and story. The paintings have way more to say than what the viewer can visually see, but that's ultimately left by Ben in his artwork for the viewers to interpret with their own experiences.
