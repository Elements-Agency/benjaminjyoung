**Okay** depicts a human hand, my hand, sketched in pencil with a focus on realism and attention to detail. It is positioned in a relaxed pose, resting to the side of my leg with the fingers slightly curled inward. I have taken care to render the textures and lines on the skin, showing the unique patterns and creases that can be found on a personâ€™s palm and fingers.

The shading is subtle yet effective, providing a sense of depth and form to the hand. The pencil strokes vary in intensity, suggesting the play of light across the hand's surface. The fingernails are well-defined and the knuckles are gently implied by the contours of the lines.

The background is minimalist, a textured grey that complements the graphite medium, ensuring that the hand is the focal point of the piece. The overall impression is one of a quiet moment captured on paper, with a tangible sense of the weight and presence of an okay hand sign.

### Inspiration ###

Hands are hard to draw, according to some people, so I took it as a challenge to draw a hand to hone my sketching skills. I drew my own right hand, but mirrored; scar on the thumb included.
