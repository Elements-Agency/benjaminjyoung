**Pink Orchid** is a quick and easy graphite pencil sketch painted in with watercolor. This simple small artwork is a nice little decoration to hang in your room. Orchids being one of my favorite flowers, usually white though, I decided to go with a pink one instead to avoid having to paint a background.
