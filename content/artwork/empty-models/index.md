**Empty Models** is a still life painting featuring a collection of objects arranged on a surface. The composition includes two bottles, one with a dark red cap and the other in green, along with a green jug and a brown bowl. The bottles and jug have a reflective quality suggested by the use of light and dark tones, indicating the presence of light from a specific angle. In it, I employed a textural technique to give the objects a tactile feel. The background and surface on which the items rest are rendered with broad strokes of brown and white, creating a rustic ambiance that complements the simple, everyday nature of the subjects. The color palette is predominantly earthy, with variations of green, brown, and yellow hues, giving the painting a warm and cozy atmosphere. The artwork captures the simple beauty of the objects and the play of light and shadow on their surfaces, including the light cast through their glass.

### Inspiration ###

This was my first painting, and it only happened after I stumbled upon an old art lesson book with some included oil pastels. I wanted to test what I could still accomplish.
