**Empty Models** is a still life painting featuring a collection of objects arranged on a surface. The composition includes two bottles, one with a dark red cap and the other in green, along with a green jug and a brown bowl. The bottles and jug have a reflective quality suggested by the use of light and dark tones, indicating the presence of light from a specific angle. In it, I employed a textural technique to give the objects a tactile feel. The background and surface on which the items rest are rendered with broad strokes of brown and white, creating a rustic ambiance that complements the simple, everyday nature of the subjects. The color palette is predominantly earthy, with variations of green, brown, and yellow hues, giving the painting a warm and cozy atmosphere. The artwork captures the simple beauty of the objects and the play of light and shadow on their surfaces, including the light cast through their glass.

### Inspiration ###

This was my first painting, and it only happened after I stumbled upon an old art lesson book with some included oil pastels. I wanted to test what I could still accomplish.

Or maybe construction paper. I'm not too sure, since it was paper left from the lesson book.

Here is an visual overview of the progress:

The majority of the artwork was done in two evenings. But that was the build the basic shapes. From there it took a week of coming back to it and fixing details or filling in imperfections. The old pastels I had on hand did not make things easier.

## About the Artist ##

{{< img class="benprolite" width="150px" height="150px" src="/images/ben-small.webp" alt="Photo of Benjamin J. Young" title="Ben Young" >}}

Ben Young in childhood, with his artistic talents, started to home in on impressionism as his preferred methodology. It's been some time since he's used those artistic skills, but this artwork is one of many where those talents are starting to bubble back to the service as Ben ventures back in to visual arts.
