title: Empty Models
description: Empty Models is a first piece back in art, after a 18 year hiatus since childhood. A still life study after discovering old oil pastels stored away in storage.
alt: The oil pastel painting by Ben Young shows a textured still life composition of two green bottles, a green jug, and a brown bowl on a hung white fabric surface against a dark wooden background.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Drawn with oil pastels on pastel paper. I still don't know if this is considered a "painting" or "drawing". The majority of the artwork was done in two evenings. But that was the build the basic shapes. From there it took a week of coming back to it and fixing details or filling in imperfections. The old pastels I had on hand did not make things easier.

**Empty Models** is a still life painting featuring a collection of objects arranged on a surface. The composition includes two bottles, one with a dark red cap and the other in green, along with a green jug and a brown bowl. The bottles and jug have a reflective quality suggested by the use of light and dark tones, indicating the presence of light from a specific angle. In it, I employed a textural technique to give the objects a tactile feel. The background and surface on which the items rest are rendered with broad strokes of brown and white, creating a rustic ambiance that complements the simple, everyday nature of the subjects. The color palette is predominantly earthy, with variations of green, brown, and yellow hues, giving the painting a warm and cozy atmosphere. The artwork captures the simple beauty of the objects and the play of light and shadow on their surfaces, including the light cast through their glass.

### Inspiration ###

This was my first painting, and it only happened after I stumbled upon an old art lesson book with some included oil pastels. I wanted to test what I could still accomplish.
