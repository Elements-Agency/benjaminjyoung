**Tawny Lily** is a quick and easy graphite pencil sketch painted in with watercolor. This simple small artwork is a nice little decoration to hang in your room. The Tiger Lily or Tawny Lily, is my favorite flower. Even though I normally decorate my home with either orchids or white lilies, the orange flower is one that grew wild in the valley I grew up in along the ponds and creek sides.
