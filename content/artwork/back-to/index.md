In the midst of a serene, snow-covered landscape, a solitary figure captures our attention in this evocative painting, titled **Back To**. The setting is quiet and isolated, the trees on either side bare and dormant, suggesting the deep chill of winter. The path stretches endlessly forward, disappearing into the vanishing point on the horizon, a metaphor perhaps for life's journey or the passage of time.

The figure, placed in the lower third of the composition, is rendered in shadowy blues and blacks, contrasting with the stark whiteness of the snow. This choice of placement and color imbues the scene with a sense of introspection and solitude. The person's back is turned towards us, inviting viewers to project their own feelings of reflection or loneliness onto the scene.

Textures in the painting were deliberate, somewhat rough strokes to create the trees and snow, giving the work a tactile quality that emphasizes the harshness of winter. Despite the overall quietness of the scene, there's a dynamic interplay of light and shadow, which adds depth and dimension to the work. This painting, with its subdued palette and stark composition, offers a contemplative space for the viewer to ponder themes of solitude, the passage of time, and the beauty of a winter's day.

This is the second iteration in the [Winter Escape series](/tags/winter-escape-series).

### Inspiration ###

{{< img src="reference.webp" width="200px" height="267px" class="floatright" gallery="progress" alt="Back To Reference Photo" title="Snow covered Towpath trail" link="reference.jpg" >}}

I have walked many times on the [Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail](https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/the-towpath-trail/), especially through winter's snow. There is just something enchanting on those hikes, when no one else is on that trail, and all you have are the noises of the winter wind and snowfall. This artwork is meant to depict and resonate those feelings. Continuing forward with the narrative and story I want to show in the [Winter Escape series](/tags/winter-escape-series).

I can say with confidence I have spent more time on the Towpath Trail than most, other than a select few. I have traveled it's crushed limestone path on foot and bicycle tie as my second home.

I used a lot of white [M.

Including using a spray bottle filled with a white gouache solution to give a sense of depth and the effect of snow in one of the final steps. I stuck entirely to my [Princeton Aqua Elite set](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Fprinceton-aqua-elite-series-4850-synthetic-brushes-set-of-4%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D05468-1049%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=05468-1049) set for paint brushes.

Here is an visual overview of the progress:

This took quite some time and a many number of glazing layers. To create the depth of trees, I of course had to brush several layers of trees.
