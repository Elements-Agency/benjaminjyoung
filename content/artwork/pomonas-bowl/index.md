**Pomona's Bowl** is my practiced attempt finalize my technique, using abstract vibrant brushwork, to create my own desired style in the realism oil painting realm. With every still life, I use it methodically to refine how I want to improve or change my artwork. This still life opulence in a bowl to me is the overwhelming first step to finally realize my artistic painting style that I want to utilize in the direction of how I want my landscape and narrative pieces to convey from here on out. It is an accomplish in my own eyes, and what I consider the turning stone to take my work to the next level. Featuring a pomegranate fruit resting in a reflective metal bowl. Split open with it's glossy seeds spilling out. The red velvet table cloth drapes the cold black table, sitting along in the light of the room. The vibrancy of the hues of red, violet, blue, yellows, purple, pink, and peach; blend together to construct this oil painting that seems reminiscent of scene from the old masters. Looking closely, you can see each section of abstract artwork, slathered on by the soft bristles of my brush to construct something beautifully grand as you step back to take it all in at once.

### Inspiration ###

After completing [my second oil painting](/artwork/massillon-helmet), I realized the missing element of what I was missing to bring my realism to the next level, was abstract brush work. So I set out starting this painting with that as the only priority to practice and utilize in it. As you view the artwork up close, you can see the grains and multi-directions of every brush stroke. Ransom impasto chunks of color are vomited on the page. All the imperfections and chaos, form something grand and beautiful when you step back and take it all in. Just as it is with life it's self. Perfection is bland and boring, but the imperfections we have in everything are what make up the character of that entity and contrast the beauty, and that was the end ambition I pursued with this painting.
