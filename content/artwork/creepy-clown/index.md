title: Creepy Clown
description: Creepy Clown is a tiny canvas painted with oil for a friend of mine and her appreciation of creepy/scary clowns.
alt: This painting by Ben Young is a close up oil painting of creepy looking clown's nose and part of it's scary smile.

progress: Painted on tiny stretched canvas with oil paint, this painting was painted like most of my realism works. After drawing a basic pencil guide, in this case just a circle for the nose and the lines for the eyes and smile. Starting the painting process from the top left corner and painting my way down to the bottom right corner, section by section. To avoid smudging my hand on existing wet paint. Being a small work, it only took a few hours to complete this artwork. Most of that time was spent at the table with my date, as they painted their own tiny canvas with me.

**Creepy Clown** was a quick artwork done on a tiny canvas, that I did as a gift to a friend. Who has an appreciation for creepy clowns and serial killers. While I don't share those interests, I did my best to try to convey that sense allure on this 4x4in square, making quick work of it. The design was heavily inspired by the first IT Movie's antagonist clown character. The yellow tinted smiling teeth were captured well, wrapping around the edge of the canvas.

This is painting is the first one apart of the [small works collection](/tags/small-works-series).
