title: Silent Reflections
description: Silent Reflections is such a simple watercolor painting, set on a misty lake surround by rolling forrest hills. The subject of a boat gliding across the water.
alt: This painting by Ben Young shows a solitary boat moving across a lake, in a muted watercolor landscape shrouded in a misty atmosphere.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Painted with watercolor paint on a cold press cotton watercolor block. I built up the background first in many layers until I had what I wanted, then used watercolor pencil with water to build up the boat and darker ripple parts. Using the watercolor pencil again, but keeping it dry on the lighter ripple effects. Also using hints of yellow pencil and other small detailed corrections through the rest of the painting.

This watercolor painting, titled "**Silent Reflections**," captures a serene and contemplative scene of two individuals in a small boat on a vast, calm body of water. The palette consists primarily of muted blues and grays, creating a tranquil and misty atmosphere. Light touches of yellow kiss the finer details to show the dancing of light. The reflections on the water's surface are subtly rendered, blending seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. In the background, the faint outlines of forested hills fade into the horizon, shrouded in a gentle haze. This watercolor painting is a  peaceful and introspective work of art.

### Inspiration ###

I wanted to go back to my simplistic roots and building up the shadows, when I did [Escape](/artwork/escape). So this was my creative idea to paint this scene, but just this time lacking any cold weather and replacing it with a morning mist set across a lake. I wanted to ensure I set the mood to a calm and tranquil effect, so this could be something to enjoy peacefully in one's home. Perhaps someone who enjoys the hobby of fishing?
