title: Erie Rock
description: Erie Rock is watercolor painting of a monolith rock that rarely comes in sight on Lake Erie's shores. A stone that stands guard under an overcast sky.
alt: This watercolor painting by Ben Young is an ethereal and solitary stone monolith, crowned with verdant trees, rises from the misty waters of a tranquil lake, embodying a quiet testament to nature's enduring strength and mystery.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Painted with watercolor paint on a cold press cotton watercolor block. My style generally focuses on impressionism, with certain elements shifting to realism that I want to draw focus to. This artwork however was a little different from that, where the realism elements where much more present than my other art pieces. This was a very labor intensive and detailed piece. Many stages of doing a layer, drying, and continuing on with the next step. I enjoyed the journey though and it's one of my favorite artworks. I later learned that my for this painting technique closely matches the master artist, Andrew Wyeth.

This evocative painting captures a unique and striking rock formation located along the shores of Lake Erie, near Cleveland, Ohio, portraying a natural monument that stands as a silent guardian amidst the lapping waves. The overcast sky suggests a typical Great Lakes ambiance, while the resilient trees on the rock's summit are a testament to nature's adaptability in the face of the elements. The artwork invites contemplation on the enduring beauty of Lake Erie's coastal landscape, subtly colored by the artist to reflect the area's serene yet dynamic character.

This is a rare display on a low tide of Lake Erie, out of Lakewood Ohio. The photos were [featured in the news](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/photos-show-rare-phenomenon-on-lake-erie/). When the winds hit an unusual high speed that day, 60mph, it pushed the water back enough to expose this rock work island. The island stands guardian to the lakeside, almost similar to the Guardian statues that call Cleveland their home. This is an area I bicycle through frequently, and I am an adventure of the outdoors.

My style generally focuses on impressionism, with certain elements shifting to realism that I want to draw focus to. This artwork however was a little different from that, where the realism elements where much more present than my other art pieces.
