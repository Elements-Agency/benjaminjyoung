title: Escape
description: Escape is such a simplistic water color painting, set in a snowy vast field, that with very few effects I was able to convey the emotion and depth of what I wanted resonate with both myself and any viewer of the artwork. Showing the trek of the lone figure who's identiy is up to interpretation.
