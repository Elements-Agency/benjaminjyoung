**Escape** is a painting that depicts a tranquil winter scene, including a solitary figure is shown walking away from the viewer, journeying along a curved path that has been carved through the snow from what may have been a vehicle. With overcast skies, soft grays and cobalts that blend seamlessly with the snowy ground,  tire tracks that are visible in the snow, all reinforcing the sense that the figure has journeyed alone. The overall mood of this watercolor painting is one of solitude and silence, evoking a sense of introspection or the quiet beauty of nature in winter.

This is the first iteration in the [Winter Escape series](/tags/winter-escape-series).

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration was simply because I do enjoy the peacefulness and tranquility of the snow. It was such a simple and minimalistic idea and painting, but the outcome had a lot of depth.

The challenge I took on with this piece was to stay simple as possible. Very few elements were included, and all but one of those features muted, to leave an isolating effect of the lone hiker to convey his possible struggle trudging through the snowy field. The figure's form is based on my own black deep winter attire, but it's ultimately up to the interpretation of the viewer to define who and what that figure's journey is about. That way the emotions that can hopefully resonate from cotton paper to the viewer's mind, are more easily relatable.
