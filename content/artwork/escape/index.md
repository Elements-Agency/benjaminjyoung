**Escape** is a painting that depicts a tranquil [winter scene](https://culturetourist.com/cultural-tourism/winter-in-art-20-most-beautiful-winter-themed-paintings/). A solitary figure is shown walking away from the viewer, journeying along a curved path that has been carved through the snow from what may have been a vehical. The figure is clad entirely in black, providing a stark contrast to the overwhelmingly white and gray/blue tones of the snowy landscape. To the right of the path, a line of fence posts gradually disappears into the distance, accentuating the depth of the scene and leading the eye towards a hazy background that suggests a forest or treeline shrouded in the mist of a cold winter day.

The sky is overcast, painted in soft grays and colbolts that blend seamlessly with the snowy ground, which is untouched except for the path. Footprints are visible in the snow, reinforcing the sense that the figure has journeyed alone. The painting's palette is quite restrained, dominated by whites and grays with just the black of the figure's clothing providing contrast.

The overall mood of the painting is one of solitude and silence, evoking a sense of introspection or the quiet beauty of nature in winter. The technique is done with watercolor, highlighting the fluidity of the colors and the soft gradients that suggest the chill and dampness of the snowy environment.

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration was simply because I do enjoy the peacefulness and tranquility of the snow. It was such a simple and minimimalistic idea and painting, but the outcome had a lot of depth.

I was inspired by my love of snowy landscapes, and wanted to somehow convey not only the tranquility of it's emptiness but the peaceful and meditative feeling I can achieve that comes with muting silence being in a snowfall in the middle of no-where. The rolling landscape painted is what I am familiar with in the Appalachian Plateaus of Ohio. Whenever I meditate, I use a memory of sitting alone on an empty forrest hill, while the snowflakes fall, dampening any noise and providing a special type of silence I can't describe in words. This painting is an extension of those feelings of calmness for me.

The challenge I took on with this piece was to stay simple as possible. Very few elements were included, and all but one of those features muted, to leave an isolating effect of the lone hiker to convey his possible struggle trudging through the snowy field. The figure's form is based on my own black deep winter attire, but it's ultimately up to the interpretation of the viewer to define who and what that figure's journey is about. That way the emotions that can hopefully resonate from cotton paper to the viewer's mind, are more easily relatable.

### Process ###

This took a few stages of adding layers, but it still only took a few days at most to include drying times.

The artwork is painted with watercolor paint on Baohong's cold press cotton watercolor paper block. I used mainly my Princeton Velvetouch long round brush, but occassasionaly my Princeton Aqua Elite set for certain softer features (e.g. the wash).
