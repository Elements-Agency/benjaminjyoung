**Standoff** portrays a poignant scene of two dark, silhouetted figures standing at a distance from each other in a sprawling, golden field of tall grass. The figure on the left is a woman, her form graceful but motionless, while the man on the right stands rigidly, facing away. The muted, overcast sky adds a somber tone to the setting, as the distant hills fade into the horizon. The vastness of the landscape, combined with the physical separation between the figures, evokes a powerful sense of emotional distance and quiet tension, as if they are connected yet worlds apart. The earthy colors and subtle textures enhance the paintingâ€™s contemplative, melancholic atmosphere.

### Artwork Process ###

This one was pretty straight forward. I started it originally to test a new technique of using masking liquid to help paint grass. Plus my lack of grass detailing in Howard's Hills left me hungry to paint something new to try it out. I blocked in the shapes, and from there it was just a matter of layering up the details and deepening the values.
