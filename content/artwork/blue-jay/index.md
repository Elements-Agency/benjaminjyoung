**Blue Jay** depicts a blue jay perched on a snowy surface, delicately pecking at a cluster of red berries on a nearby branch. The bird's vivid blue plumage, accented with black and white markings, contrasts beautifully with the soft, white snow. I captured the texture of the bird's feathers and the intricate details of the berries and branches. The overall scene exudes a serene winter atmosphere, with the red berries adding a touch of color and life to the otherwise muted background.

This drawing is apart of the [Primary Winter Birds Collection](/tags/primary-winter-birds-series).

**Original and prints will be for sale SOON.**

This drawing was done to add to the [Primary Winter Birds Collection](/tags/primary-winter-birds), as the second and blue of the three primary birds. It also shares it's middle name with the artist, Jay. ðŸ˜†
