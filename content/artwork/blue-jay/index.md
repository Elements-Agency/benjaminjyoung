**Blue Jay** depicts a blue jay perched on a snowy surface, delicately pecking at a cluster of red berries on a nearby branch. The bird's vivid blue plumage, accented with black and white markings, contrasts beautifully with the soft, white snow. I captured the texture of the bird's feathers and the intricate details of the berries and branches. The overall scene exudes a serene winter atmosphere, with the red berries adding a touch of color and life to the otherwise muted background.
