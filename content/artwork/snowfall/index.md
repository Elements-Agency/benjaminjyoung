tag: The snowfall to me is such a funny thing. Its tranquility is something I’ve grown to love. In adolescence, it became my medium for meditation. To escape the busyness of the world with the flutter of falling flakes. Yet, I’ve realized it’s what’s responsible for troubling my heart. I lost the love of my life only due to the icy weather. With the snow, only did that violent cluster of twisted automobile came into existence. Many years later, waiting for snowfall for my last moments became an obsession. I found a place to spectate that last snowfall, where water falls in the forest to carve stone. As I lean against an old maple’s trunk, I lay watching guard of a stone grotto temple at the base of the falling stream. This temple has no worshipers but only prayers from the whistling branches. There is a sacredness I find in this place’s beauty. A sacredness I myself no longer share. The lone guard of this temple has grown old and tired. Complacent with the agonies of life. The frozen flakes drift down to smother most sounds. Blanketing me with its comfort. The wind kisses my neck, running it’s chilling fingers down my spine. My dulled and greyed eyes grow heavy. From the little light left from the winter night sky, glistens the landscape to reveal a faint figure in the dark’s thickness. It’s my love greeting me to a long-awaited reunion. Reaching her hands out for mine, closer and closer as her figure enclosed in on my restful state. Until her spirit wraps around me. Her warm embrace only cools. First my skin, then the fibers of my being. Now finally the cold creeping into my slowing heart.

This painting is apart of the [Feb 26th Collection](/collections/feb-26)

This watercolor painting depicts a lone figure sitting against a tree in a dark, snow-covered forest. The person is dressed in a hooded cloak, their face partially hidden in shadow, exuding a sense of solitude and introspection. The surrounding trees are bare and stand tall, their dark trunks contrasting starkly with the white snow that blankets the ground. The background fades into deep darkness, enhancing the painting’s moody and melancholic atmosphere. The subtle blending of colors and the soft texture of the watercolor medium add depth to the scene, evoking a quiet, contemplative moment in the cold wilderness.

### Artwork Process ###

Another large watercolor work. Always working in layers upon layers with watercolor. I started by blacking out the darkest value elements, after the sketch.
