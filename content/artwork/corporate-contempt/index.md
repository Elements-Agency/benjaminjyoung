tag: For 15 years, I built a career in software engineering. Working my way up the white-collar ladder. At the height of my career, working up to the Director or Executive level. At times, running my own businesses. My same-aged friends coined the nickname “Young Money” for me, which I was never big on being titled. Sooner or later, I believe all of us working in an office setting eventually reflect and ask ourselves, “What am I doing?” Questioning if what we’re doing is even meaningful. Maybe longing for the outdoors and venturing into the rest of the world beyond the concrete highrise walls in that corporate park. This painting is meant to exemplify that moment of reflection.

_In 2021:_ For 15 years, I built a career in software engineering. Working my way up the white-collar ladder. At the height of my career, working up to the Director or Executive level. At times, running my own businesses. My same-aged friends coined the nickname “Young Money” for me, which I was never big on being titled. Sooner or later, I believe all of us working in an office setting eventually reflect and ask ourselves, “What am I doing?” Questioning if what we’re doing is even meaningful. Maybe longing for the outdoors and venturing into the rest of the world beyond the concrete highrise walls in that corporate park. This painting is meant to exemplify that moment of reflection.

This watercolor painting presents a moody, atmospheric scene of a solitary man standing in a dimly lit office. The composition uses strong contrasts of light and shadow, with sunlight streaming through large glass windows on the left, casting elongated shadows across the floor. The man, dressed in a dark suit, stands with his back to the viewer, gazing towards a simple wooden desk adorned with papers, a computer, and other office essentials. The room has a minimalist, almost surreal feel, with sparse furniture—a single office chair and framed artworks on the walls—enhancing the sense of isolation. The color palette is dominated by earthy tones, giving the scene a melancholic and introspective quality, reminiscent of Edward Hopper’s style. The overall effect is one of contemplation, solitude, and perhaps existential reflection.

_Title was changed from "Young Money" to "Corporate Contempt" on July 10th, 2025. Alternatively can be title to as "Pending Trial"._
