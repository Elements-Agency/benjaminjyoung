I knew an old wise woman once. She told me to make my way back to Strasbourg, so I did. From her pine framed window, she bid farewell, "**Okay now**. I'll be seeing you." With her gaze and expression of both endearment and concern, but excitement for me. Looking on in to the day's sun. This painting perfectly captures those feelings and experiences with my dear old friend.

This watercolor painting captures a moment of quiet contemplation, featuring an elderly woman leaning out of a rustic wooden window. Her face is rich with detail, marked by deep wrinkles and a thoughtful expression, accentuated by her large glasses that reflect subtle light. The dark background contrasts with her warm, earthy skin tones and the light-colored blouse she wears, emphasizing her presence and evoking a sense of nostalgia. The worn texture of the wooden frame adds an authentic, aged character to the composition, further enhancing the storytelling within this evocative portrait.

This painting is apart of the [Shades of Olson Collection](/collections/shades-of-olson).

### Inspiration ###

The painting depicts an altered version of an old and wise friend of mine.

### Artwork Process ###

I approached this much like I did [Hallelujah](/artwork/hallelujah), working inch by inch. At least on the face. The background was done wet-on-wet, and building up as it dried.
