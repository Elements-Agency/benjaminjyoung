The **Massillon Helmet** is an oil painting depicting a solitary, black American Massillon Tiger's football helmet in a three-quarter view, featuring a bold orange Massillon Ohio letter 'M' logo outlined in white, symbolizing Washington Highschool team identity and spirit. I have rendered the subject with a strong attention to detail, from the subtle reflections and shadows on the helmet's glossy surface to the intricate structure of the face mask and the secure clasps. The background is a neutral, gradient shade that throws the focus entirely on the helmet, evoking a sense of nostalgia and tiger pride, typical of sports memorabilia.

### Inspiration ###

After completion of my first [oil painting](/artwork/cherry-popping), I learned a lot from that experience. With this being only my second oil painting, I revised my realism technique. Instead of painting in layers like the first, I took an approach of mixing and color matching each color, and painting section by section. Since the [Massillon Museum](http://massillonmuseum.org/)'s "[Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org/home/special-exhibits/)", which must include the theme of either [Paul Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brown) or [Massillon Football](https://massillontigers.com), I decided to make my subject comply with this requirement as a way to enter in my first exhibit. I have roots in both Ohio, and lived in Massillon for a number of years.

Here is an visual overview of the progress:

Painting part by part, instead of layering, it took an extensive amount of time to mix and color match, and ensure I touched on every detail of the helmet and lighting. This was my longest and most complicated artwork yet. But it has proven how much more heighten realism it turned out to be.
