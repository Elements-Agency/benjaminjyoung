tag: The man walking is myself, with the blond hair shimmering from the bright autumn sun. The companion by my side is my late Border Collie dog, Izzy. The landscape is inspired by the Ohio Appalachian Plateau hills I grew up with. It's a memory I never got to have with my faithful family member, before she passed. She was always by my side in her life span, but sometimes time escapes us too quickly, and by the time I was in healthy enough state to hike myself, she had grown too elderly and weary to join me in my long walks of reflection.

_Based on July 1st, 2021:_ **One Last Walk With Izzy** is a exquisite watercolor painting depicting a peaceful countryside scene, where a man walks alongside his faithful Border Collie dog companion across gently rolling hills bathed in golden sunlight. The vibrant hues of green and yellow fields blend harmoniously with the rich textures of the trees, creating a sense of depth and tranquility. A cozy house sits nestled on the distant hill, framed by soft clouds drifting through a serene sky. This artwork beautifully captures the simplicity and charm of rural life, making it a perfect piece for adding warmth and a touch of nature to any space.

### Inspiration ###

The man of course is myself, the artist, with the blond hair shimmering from the bright autumn sun. The companion by my side is my late Border Collie dog, Izzy. The landscape is inspired by the Ohio Appalachian Plateau hills I grew up with. It's a memory I never got to have with my faithful family member, before she passed. She was always by my side in her life span, but sometimes time escapes us too quickly, and by the time I was in healthy enough state to hike myself, she had grown too elderly and weary to join me in my long walks of reflection.

### Narrative ###

The building in the distance is an important element, as it's a play on the white lie, "taken to a farm upstate". Where parents of my generation would use to describe the death of a family pet. As this is the direction both Izzy and myself are walking in that direction, together. By each other's side, much how insisted to be with her upon her final moments.

### Artwork Process ###

I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for stating this, but to me this piece starts to transcends in to impressionism. A different, warmer and earthly color pallet was use, one that you will likely see continue in my other watercolor paintings, but the use of brush strokes is abstract and impressionistic magic. If you study the details closely, it's a chaotic mess. After stepping away, you see the entirety of the painting is my own little magic trick. Tricking the eyes and perception of the view to form something in mind to render in their brain it's a scene. To me, I have no desire in to journeying in to ultra-realism, but I love the trickery of using chaos to create something more grand and beautiful. Much as I hope this painting achieves.

The painting follows the rest of my recent Wyeth-like paintings. Starting from washing, blocking in colors with wet-on-wet, and then building up details with drier and drier paint strokes.

A new technique I used in this, was leaving some of the white paper exposed as my whites, at least on the man and dog figures. I wanted to give this a try after looking at and studying one paintings of my cycling friends (and fellow watercolor artist), [Ted Lawson](https://tedlawsonartist.com).
