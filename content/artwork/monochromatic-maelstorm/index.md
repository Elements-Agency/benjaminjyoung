title: Mono-chromatic Maelstorm
description: Monochromatic Maelstorm is an attempt to explore abstract watercolor painting. But the abstraction is subjectively representative of a water swirl.
alt: This is an abstract watercolor painting by Ben Young featuring dynamic blue and black brushstrokes, with splatters and washes creating a sense of movement and swirl.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Watercolor of cold press wood pulp paper, taped down. Quick and easy. Two or three stages of layers and steps. I believe it only took two days, if that.

**Monochromatic Maelstorm** is an abstract painting. The color palette is primarily monochromatic, featuring different shades of black, gray, and white, with some areas where a deep, navy-like blue is present. The composition is dynamic, with fluid shapes and splatters distributed across the canvas. The use of black and blue creates a sense of depth and contrast against the lighter areas. There are also spots where the paint seems to have been allowed to drip or splatter freely, giving the piece a spontaneous and expressive feel.

I wanted to test working with the watercolor paints before moving on to attempt [Dyzee](/artwork/dyzee).
