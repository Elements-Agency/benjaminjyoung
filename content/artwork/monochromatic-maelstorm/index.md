**Monochromatic Maelstorm** is an abstract painting. The color palette is primarily monochromatic, featuring different shades of black, gray, and white, with some areas where a deep, navy-like blue is present. The composition is dynamic, with fluid shapes and splatters distributed across the canvas. The use of black and blue creates a sense of depth and contrast against the lighter areas. There are also spots where the paint seems to have been allowed to drip or splatter freely, giving the piece a spontaneous and expressive feel.

The painting lacks defined forms or figures, which is typical of abstract art, where the focus is on the colors, textures, and the emotional response they may evoke rather than on depicting recognizable objects or scenes. The technique used involved both controlled brushwork and a degree of letting the paint behave naturally, evidenced by the drips and splashes.
