The **Cherry Popping** painting depicts two cherries with a realistic appearance. The cherries are rich red with subtle hints of darker tones suggesting volume and curvature. A light source is shining from the upper left, casting a soft shadow to the lower right of the cherries and giving a glossy highlight on their surfaces. The cherries are attached to each other by a green stem, which is connected to only one of the cherries at the top right corner of the painting. The background is plain and light-colored, putting the full focus on the vibrancy and detail of the cherries. The technique used provides a sense of texture that one can almost feel, and the attention to detail in the reflections and shadows is a careful study of light on the fruit's surface.

### Inspiration ###

This study was my first oil painting, hence the name "Cherry Popping". I wanted to do a painting to explore how to use and manipulate oil paint. So it was essentially an exploration and mainly a learning artwork piece.
