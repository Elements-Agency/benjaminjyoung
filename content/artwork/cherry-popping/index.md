The **Cherry Popping** painting depicts two cherries with a realistic appearance. The cherries are rich red with subtle hints of darker tones suggesting volume and curvature. A light source is shining from the upper left, casting a soft shadow to the lower right of the cherries and giving a glossy highlight on their surfaces. The cherries are attached to each other by a green stem, which is connected to only one of the cherries at the top right corner of the painting. The background is plain and light-colored, putting the full focus on the vibrancy and detail of the cherries. The technique used provides a sense of texture that one can almost feel, and the attention to detail in the reflections and shadows is a careful study of light on the fruit's surface.

### Inspiration ###

This study was my first oil painting, hence the name "Cherry Popping". I wanted to do a painting to explore how to use and manipulate oil paint. So it was essentially an exploration and mainly a learning artwork piece.

Here is an visual overview of the progress:

I used layering to paint this canvas. It took time to constantly correct the color and values, as the paint would mix with the existing layers and tint it.

## About the Artist ##

Ben Young grew up in childhood with an amazing artistic talent, which sadly was dropped in pre-teenage years. Now he's back trying to refresh those skills in to his artwork, 18 years later. Studies such as these are helping him refine those skill sets, especially as he's still trying to find his own style of visual arts.
