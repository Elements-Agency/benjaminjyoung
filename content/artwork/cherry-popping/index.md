title: Cherry Popping
description: Cherry Popping was my first oil painting, to practice using oil paints, learning how to manipulate it. Featuring two Red Cherry fruits.
alt: This is a realistic painting of two cherries connected by their stems, with a play of light and shadow enhancing their rich red color.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: This was painted using Oil Paint on Canvas Panel. I used layering to paint this canvas. It took time to constantly correct the color and values, as the paint would mix with the existing layers and tint it. There is a bit of layered buildup on the right cherry, as I let that part accidentally sit to long and dry, before I had the chance to blend it like I originally wanted to with the base layer of paint.

The **Cherry Popping** painting depicts two cherries with a realistic appearance. The cherries are rich red with subtle hints of darker tones suggesting volume and curvature. A light source is shining from the upper left, casting a soft shadow to the lower right of the cherries and giving a glossy highlight on their surfaces. The cherries are attached to each other by a green stem, which is connected to only one of the cherries at the top right corner of the painting. The background is plain and light-colored, putting the full focus on the vibrancy and detail of the cherries. The technique used provides a sense of texture that one can almost feel, and the attention to detail in the reflections and shadows is a careful study of light on the fruit's surface.

### Inspiration ###

This study was my first oil painting, hence the name "Cherry Popping". I wanted to do a painting to explore how to use and manipulate oil paint. So it was essentially an exploration and mainly a learning artwork piece.
