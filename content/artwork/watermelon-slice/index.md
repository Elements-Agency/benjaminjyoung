Juicy! A fruity painting that depicts a slice of watermelon. Watermelon Slice is a realistic drawing that captures the vibrant red flesh of the fruit, complete with black seeds scattered throughout. The watermelon slice has a green rind, transitioning from a darker green on the outside to a paler green towards the inner red flesh. The drawing has a textured appearance from the water colored pencils, and thereâ€™s a gentle shadow under the slice, giving it a sense of depth and dimension. The background is plain and lightly textured. Hang it up in your summer themed kitchen, like the basic, normal, coffee drinking, white person you are.

The inspiration for this artwork was simply to test my new water color pencil set, and use brushstrokes of water to blend the pigment.
