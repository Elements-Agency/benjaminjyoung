Juicy! A [fruity painting](https://artincontext.org/famous-fruit-paintings/) that depicts a slice of watermelon. Watermelon Slice is a realistic drawing that captures the vibrant red flesh of the fruit, complete with black seeds scattered throughout. The watermelon slice has a green rind, transitioning from a darker green on the outside to a paler green towards the inner red flesh. The drawing has a textured appearance from the water colored pencils, and thereâ€™s a gentle shadow under the slice, giving it a sense of depth and dimension. The background is plain and lightly textured. Hang it up in your summer themed kitchen, like the basic, normal, coffee drinking, white person you are.

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration for this artwork was simply to test my new water color pencil set, and use brushtrokes of water to blend the pigment.

### Process ###

I drew this with [watercolor pencils](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Ffaber-castell-albrecht-durer-watercolor-pencils-set-of-24%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D20567-0249%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=20567-0249) on [watercolor pad paper](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Ffaber-castell-watercolor-pad-9x-12-90-lb-15-sheets%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D10163-1001%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=10163-1001).
