**Tiny Football** was another quick artwork done on a tiny canvas. A tribute to one of Canton's large driving parts of their economy, American Football. Since our city hosts the [Pro Football Hall of Fame](https://www.profootballhof.com), which is the biggest reason for tourism and festivals in our tiny city, I figured it was a good idea to have this sitting out on my studio space as a pick-me-up. Sports!
