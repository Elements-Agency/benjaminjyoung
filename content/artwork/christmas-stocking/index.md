This watercolor painting depicts a bold and festive red Christmas stocking adorned with the name "Ben" in dark, block letters at its center. The stocking's textured surface showcases rich, layered shades of red, giving it a realistic and slightly worn appearance, while its white, fluffy cuff contrasts beautifully with a subtle mix of cream tones, evoking a cozy, wintry feel. The dark, almost black background creates a dramatic contrast, making the stocking the focal point and giving the composition a sense of warmth and nostalgia.

Not a serious piece, but I painted this over a few hours to have a decoration to throw up as my "Christmas Stocking" as a resident artist of Patina Arts Centre. The artwork is currently not for sale and is meant to be only decorative for me personally.
