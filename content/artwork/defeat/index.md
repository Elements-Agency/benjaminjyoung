tag: A few years ago I had accomplished a dream of mine and won my way with my beloved team to the United States Tennis Association National Championships. I had spent many years prior, captaining and building teams just to fall short of winning districts each year. Finally winning our season, sectionals, districts, state, and then winning the Midwest championship; we finally did it. This painting isn't about the feeling of defeat on the court, as that's always a chance to improve and grow. I didn't lose in that aspect, because I was nearly undefeated that year and was almost a guaranteed win on doubles. This painting represents the agony, disappointment, disgust, and deceit, I felt when I learned I could not go to play alongside my friends in the championship in Scottsdale Arizona. I had let my team down and missed out on a once in a lifetime accomplishment.

This captivating watercolor painting portrays a tennis player standing tall in the midst of a vast, sunlit field, with his gaze directed upward toward the expansive blue sky. The interplay of light and shadow emphasizes the sweat glistening on his skin, capturing the raw intensity and effort of the moment. His posture, both weary and agonized, suggests a hard-fought battle, only to fall short, while the worn tennis racket in his hand hints at a story of resilience and determination. The textured brushstrokes and the rich, earthy tones of the landscape contrast beautifully with the vibrant blue sky, evoking a sense of serenity and reflection. Itâ€™s a striking composition that celebrates the spirit of emotion and the beauty of an imperfect life.
