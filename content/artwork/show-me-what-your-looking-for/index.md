As I sit hidden away in the lounge corner of a dance club, I scan the room as I people watch the crowd. It wasn't exactly a good point in my life, as I was still young and inexperienced to dealing with the coldness of the world. Through the active figures, something catches my eyes. A shimmer of bright blue. Sitting at the bar is a young women peering in to my soul with a stern look on her eyes. When we lock eyes, her sternness melts with the folds forming on her dimples and eyes eclipsing. My heart is pounding with anxiety. She's too pretty for me. As I wonder if she's making the bright smile at me, she gestures for whoever she's directed at to join her. Just in case it was me she was signing to, I walk over to her to grab a drink. As I walk around the groups of people, my uncertainty goes away as I watch her gaze follow me around the room. I join her. She has a certain well-spoken intimidation to her, but a warmth that felt welcoming enough to stay. Her friendly chuckling, topics of intelligent conversations, soft touches and looks throughout the night would begin to melt my heart away.

That was the night I met Andrea.

This is the final painting of **[The Dark Trio Series](/collections/the-dark-trie)** and is the first painting in to the **[The Hart's Desire Series](/collections/the-harts-desire)**.

### Inspiration ###

This moment was a snapshot in to the time Andrea and I first met eyes on one-another. The following paintings in **[The Hart's Desire Series](/collections/the-harts-desire)** will begin to tell the story and develop the importance of who this woman was.
