title: The Artist's Assistant
description: A watercolor painting featuring a cat, named Princess. Wearing a water cup as a hat on her head. As she sits and watches the artist paint.
alt: This watercolor painting depicts a black and white cat wearing an upside-down green water cup on its head, sitting beside a tennis ball and a painting of a stick-figure family, with a paintbrush resting nearby.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: I started out with just sketching values using a pencil to form the shapes. Then, layer by layer, added the color. This painting is special in the fact I left the bare cotton paper exposed in the inception of it's self on the watercolor block in the painting. As well as finding a subtle way to integrate my signature in to the painting, on the painted painting it's self...

tag: This painting has everything you need. Cute cats, funny hats, and a dark sense of morbid humor. It features my long haired domestic black and white cat, Princess. Stuck in a scene of her by my side as I paint. Adorning my watercolor cup on her head. Her favorite Penn tennis ball resting not far away. Peering on to the cold press cotton paper watercolor block, that is painted with my late dog, Izzy, along with family. I know deep down Princess shares in my miss of Izzy. The stick figures childishly painted on the exposed cotton paper, integrated in a method of inception in to the painting. Adding to the silliness and partly dry humor.

On the surface and by design, it's meant to be humorous and lighthearted. Something to chuckle about and give a grin. To appreciate in the little life moments. It looks simple and there's no requirement to dig past that innocence. You may enjoy it without the necessity of any further analysis of the artwork. However, some of us always desire a deeper and more complex understanding. For those who know me, or those who will get to know my narrative through my art, it's a dark foreshadowing. A millennial coping mechanism to exist alongside our traumas. To laugh in the face of pain and hardships. To not forget to enjoy in the moment and not live in the past or reminisce beyond what's require to bring healing. The subtle hints within the scene, I will one day write that story with paint. For now, just enjoy the cuteness and moments life brings to offer to enjoy.

### Inspiration ###

{{< img src="reference.webp" width="200px" height="267px" class="floatright" gallery="progress" alt="Reference Photo of Princess" title="Princess Young" link="reference.jpg" >}}

The painting was mainly done while studying a reference photo I took. Actually photographed while I was painting another painting. I incorporated other elements, such as the paint brush and watercolor block, by studying on the same location as the photo was taking.

I frequently have the need to sit on the carpeted floor and paint. I just find this more comforting, which is something just originating from my childhood. Princess is most of the time laying or sitting by my side, when I paint in this spot. Normally nestling up against me or cuddling with her second-hand tennis ball, past down from me.
