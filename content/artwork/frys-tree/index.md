title: Fry's Tree
description: Fry's Tree is the lone tree at Fry Family Park, that stands out in the field's skyline, during an after sunset walk through the park.
alt: In this evocative water color painting by Ben Young, a majestic tree stands prominently against a dusky sky, its intricate branches silhouetted by the soft glow of twilight.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Painted with a watercolor paint set, eventually adding some gouache in to the darker elements, on cold press wood pulp watercolor paper, that I had to tape down (and thus the white trim border). This painting took way longer than I wanted it too. It took many layers to get the right color and value. I had to mix in gouache with the watercolors to sometimes get the opaque I desired. I began to tire of working on it, so the progress stretched out. By the time I decided for forcefully wrap it up, I felt my skills have drastically improved and the base of the painting did not meet my standards.

**Fry's Tree** portrays a solitary, robust tree standing prominently in the center against a twilight or pre-dawn sky. Set in the Fry Family Park, of East Sparta Ohio. The leaves and branches creates a lace-like pattern against the sky, which shifts from a dark blue at the top to lighter hues near the horizon, indicating dusk or the approach of nightfall. There's a sense of tranquility and solitude in this scene, as the tree stands alone in the quiet moments of transition between day and night.

The tree it's self is the lone tree that stands around a hiking trail bend at [Fry Family Park](https://starkparks.com/parks/fry-family-park/), close to near my home. This is a trail and park I frequently hike and visit, as it's the closest Stark Park to my home, in East Sparta Ohio. The photo I took that served as a reference was when I was hiking on winter, and caught the sky's twilight as a background to the tree. Creating not only a spooky, but awe-inspiring effect. It was something I had to paint.
