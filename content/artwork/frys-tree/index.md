**Fry's Tree** portrays a solitary, robust tree standing prominently in the center against a twilight or pre-dawn sky. Creating a [silhouette tree](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/06/trees-at-night-art-young/) standing as the subject. The tree's branches are dense and leafy, suggesting a full summer or pre-fall foliage. The detailed rendering of the leaves and branches creates a lace-like pattern against the sky, which shifts from a dark blue at the top to lighter hues near the horizon, indicating dusk or the approach of nightfall.

In the background, there are hints of other trees or shrubbery, but these are less detailed, adding to the sense of depth and focus on the central tree. The foreground is dominated by tall grass or underbrush, painted in a style that suggests movement, as if there's a gentle breeze passing through.

The color palette is quite naturalistic, with earthy tones for the tree and grass, which are bathed in the subtle glow of the sky's light, providing a contrast between the warmth of the tree and the coolness of the sky. The light source is not directly visible, but its effects are seen in the lighter shades on the horizon and the soft illumination of the tree's outline.

There's a sense of tranquility and solitude in this scene, as the tree stands alone in the quiet moments of transition between day and night. The painting style is detailed with a focus on texture, as seen in the strokes that define the tree's bark and leaves.

The tree it's self is the lone tree that stands around a hiking trail bend at [Fry Family Park](https://starkparks.com/parks/fry-family-park/), close to near my home. This is a trail and park I frequently hike and visit, as it's the closest Stark Park to my home, in East Sparta Ohio. The photo I took that served as a reference was when I was hiking on winter, and caught the sky's twilight as a background to the tree. Creating not only a spooky, but awinspiring effect. It was something I had to paint.

### Process ###

This painting took way longer than I wanted it too. It took many layers to get the right color and value. I had to mix in gouche with the watercolors to sometimes get the opaque I desired. I began to tire of working on it, so the progress stretched out. By the time I decided for forcefully wrap it up, I felt my skills have drastically improved and the base of the painting did not meet my standards.
