**Fry's Tree** portrays a solitary, robust tree standing prominently in the center against a twilight or pre-dawn sky. Set in the Fry Family Park, of East Sparta Ohio. The leaves and branches creates a lace-like pattern against the sky, which shifts from a dark blue at the top to lighter hues near the horizon, indicating dusk or the approach of nightfall. There's a sense of tranquility and solitude in this scene, as the tree stands alone in the quiet moments of transition between day and night.

The tree it's self is the lone tree that stands around a hiking trail bend at [Fry Family Park](https://starkparks.com/parks/fry-family-park/), close to near my home. This is a trail and park I frequently hike and visit, as it's the closest Stark Park to my home, in East Sparta Ohio. The photo I took that served as a reference was when I was hiking on winter, and caught the sky's twilight as a background to the tree. Creating not only a spooky, but awe-inspiring effect. It was something I had to paint.
