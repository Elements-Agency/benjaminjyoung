This is the final painting in to the **[The Hart's Desire Series](/collections/the-harts-desire)**. This entry concludes the narrative of this story.

___December 18th, 2013___. That damn ringing! That ringing from the machines haunts me, as it blared in to the cold night, trumpeting your departure from me. Those wales and tears would be the last deep emotional expression from me, for a long time after. Six years without any real expression. I knew facing your death would kill me, as it eventually would, so I hid it away from myself. Your last coherent words, angered me for many years. Before the babbling of nonsense took control of your vocabulary. **Pissed at your lie!** How could something you said to me in love and care, upset me so much so many years later. You promised me we would have our wedding in the following spring, and you didn't follow through. You couldn't. You knew you were going to die. We both did. Blatantly arrogant and lying in the face of death. For someone you loved dearly. Me... You were always braver than I was. My bravery wouldn't find me, until I was left alone without you. I should have been the one comforting you, with lies of love and comfort in your final moments. I should have been the one to tell you goodnight stories, describing the details of how wonderful our spring would be together. But regret filled my heart, that I never got the chance. I have forever been incapable of such a things, moments of misrepresenting the truth. Perhaps that's what I am really angry about, is my inabilities. I couldn't forgive you, that you left me. All alone to deal with the mess of emotions that your death caused. I felt abandoned and you took our unborn daughter with you. Betrayed. I kept pleading, "just five more minutes. Please! Just five more minutes..." Five more minutes to see you, to spend with you, embracing you tightly in my arms. Never wanting to let go. I would have done anything for those five more minutes, but that bargaining was a lonely desperation. I could only hold your lifeless and limp body against mine, as I felt the what warmth was left seep out. The man you made me in to, would not survive that night. Let, to rot away in the body that was left, for six full years. The cold air from that winter night and the hospital ICU would linger in me. Six years until my emotional resurrection. As painful as it was, I had to relive that night, over and over. To nullify your loss's control over my subconscious. To relive through the development of our love and to finally be able to put in to words our final moments together in painting and now here in to writing, barely sober of tears, is my last testament of healing. To finally lay you to rest, even past you being buried for so long. I will forever love you, but now is the time to finally let you go... Goodbye, my dear sweet Andrea.
