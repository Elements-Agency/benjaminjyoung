tag: A faux Stargazer lily decorated the shelves at the bar we met, which you noted it’s identity and your fixation; in the aspirations of our conversations. When you brought me home, Easter lilies decorated throughout your bedroom, complimenting the white orchid that was center stage of the contemporary decor. In one of my first attempts of affection for you, I transplanted Tawny Daylilies from the wilds of the valley where I grew up in to the suburban yard that welcomed you each weekend. It was in front of one of Monet’s works of water lilies that we first exchanged the words “I love you” to one another. You wanted Royal Lilies to partner the echos of violins at our future wedding. There was a twinkle in your eye talking about your desire to go see a vast field of **Avalanche Lilies** in the mountains. It was Madonna Lilies I placed on the mound of your grave. The repeated significance of the flower is why they were symbolically hosted in my home in troves for so long, and why a single white one was left to the lost soul that ignited my ambition to face my own loss; in a sign of both of our gratitude and valedictions. I’ve hiked and traveled the world for you; to honor both of us. Nothing has tugged more at my heartstrings than as much as this view. So… Will you sit with me, with this spectacular sunsetted view? One last time. I painted some flowers for you, my dear.

### Inspiration ###

The scene is that of avalanche lilies with Mount Rainier in the background. I creatively warped the mountain set so the composition and lines all try to draw the eye towards the center focus of the glowing flowers from the setting sun.
