**Innocence and Connection** is a true masterpiece, and both my greatest and biggest work yet! The countless hours over months this painting took me, and the excruciating details in every inch. It's a spark of genius in a 4 foot by 4 foot canvas. This painting will echo through time as one of true masterpieces to have every been painted.
