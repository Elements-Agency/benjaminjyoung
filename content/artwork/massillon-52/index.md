title: Massillon 52
description: Massillon 52 is a watercolor painting showing off Massillon Football's Joe Hallet, during the Massillon versus McKinnley game.
alt: This painting depicts two football players from Massillon team in the heat of the game, with one poised in a stance of victory or excitement and the other seemingly in motion, against the backdrop of a crowded stadium.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Painted with watercolor on cold press cotton watercolor block. This was my first figure painting while using a reference photo. I freehanded the entire thing (like I do with most of my art), starting with some simple brushstrokes to draw the basic shapes and adjusting as I go. Blocking in some colors at first, and then starting to build the dimensions and details. Very similar to my Andrew Wyeth technique I use for most of my landscape and narrative watercolor paintings.
location: This scene takes place in Massillon Ohio, at the Massillon Washington Highschool Paul Brown Stadium. During one of the Massillon Tigers vs Canton McKinley football games.

The **Massillon 52** is a vibrant watercolor painting, showcasing two Massillon Football players. Both in a moment of intense celebration. On the left, player 52 is rendered with a fierce expression. To the right, an unknown teammate engages in clapping, hands blurred to add to the effect. Behind them, the stadium is alive with spectators in the stands, out of focus. Backset all to autumn trees and vibrant green turf. I managed to infuse the scene with movement and excitement, creating a palpable sense of the game's high stakes and the players' raw emotion.

### Inspiration ###

After the deadline was extended for the [Massillon Museum](http://massillonmuseum.org/)'s "[Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org/home/special-exhibits/)", I figured I had enough time to finish this second painting, after already completing [the Massillon Helmet Oil Painting](/artwork/massillon-helmet) prior. It was a rush against the clock, but I made the deadline.

The composition of the piece was selected because it's one of my "little" cousin's favorite [Massillon Football](https://massillontigers.com) pictures while he played on varsity. I'm not much of a football fan myself, but it was a nice reference photo to paint from.
