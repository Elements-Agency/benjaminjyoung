The **Massillon 52** is a vibrant watercolor painting, where we observe a dynamic scene of American football charged with energy and emotion. Two players from the Massillon team are captured in a moment of intense celebration. On the left, a player wearing jersey number 52 is rendered with a fierce expression; his posture conveys triumph and the physical intensity of the sport. To the right, a teammate engages  in clapping, which adds a pop of color to the composition. Behind them, the stadium is alive with spectators in the stands, rendered in looser strokes that suggest a bustling crowd. The background trees with autumnal hues imply the season in which the sport is traditionally played, while the subdued, earthy tones of the field and players contrast sharply with the vibrant oranges and reds. I managed to infuse the scene with movement and excitement, creating a palpable sense of the game's high stakes and the players' raw emotion.

### Inspiration ###

After the deadline was extended for the [Massillon Museum](http://massillonmuseum.org/)'s "[Brown Town Exhibit](https://paulbrownmuseum.org/home/special-exhibits/)", I figured I had enough time to finish this second painting, after already completing [the Massillon Helmet Oil Painting](/artwork/massillon-helmet) prior. It was a rush against the clock, but I made the deadline.

The composition of the piece was selected because it's one of my "little" cousin's favorite [Massillon Football](https://massillontigers.com) pictures while he played on varsity. I'm not much of a football fan myself, but it was a nice reference photo to paint from.

### Process ###

This was my first figure painting while using a reference photo. I freehanded the entire thing (like I do with most of my art), starting with some simple brushstrokes to draw the basic shapes and adjusting as I go.

I stuck entirely to my [Princeton Aqua Elite set](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101118598-13717235?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fitems%2Fprinceton-aqua-elite-series-4850-synthetic-brushes-set-of-4%2F%3Fclicktracking%3Dtrue%26wmcp%3Dpla%26wmcid%3Ditems%26wmckw%3D05468-1049%26country%3Dus%26currency%3Dusd&cjsku=05468-1049) set for paint brushes. I used some gouache, basically to act as either underlayers or certain detail elements where I needed to layer lighter colors on top of darker elements.

I of course learned from this painting that I need to implement more abstract brush stokes in my painting.
