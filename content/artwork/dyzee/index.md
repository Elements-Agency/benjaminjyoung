title: Dyzee
description: Dyzee is an attempt to explore abstract watercolor painting. But the abstraction is subjectively representative to a floral reference by name, a Daisy flower.
alt: This is an abstract watercolor painting by Ben Young featuring dynamic blue and black brushstrokes, with splatters and washes creating a sense of movement, anchored by a central burst of yellow.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Done with a watercolor paint set on cold press wood pulp watercolor paper, taped down. This took a few stages of painting a layer and waiting for dry time. So it took a few days.

This **Dyzee** painting is an abstract composition dominated by fluid, dynamic strokes and splashes of paint. The color palette is primarily monochromatic, featuring different shades of blue and black, with a significant contrast provided by a central burst of olive or moss green. The expressive lines and shapes seem to swirl around this central point of color, creating a sense of movement that draws the eye inward. The splatters and spots of paint across the canvas add to the feeling of spontaneity and action, suggesting the artist worked quickly and with a degree of improvisation.

I simply wanted to try my hand at abstract painting. I chose a Daisy flower to derive the subject from, since my one grandmother was named Daisy. Plus, I of course do enjoy the vibrance of flowers.
