**Todd's Sunflowers** is a quick and easy graphite pencil sketch painted in with watercolor. This simple small artwork is a nice little decoration to hang in your room. Sunflowers being the favorite flower of one of my favorite painters, Van Gogh, and the added bonus of being a vibrant yellow to attract a summer time feel. My reference was my cousin's yard, so these are Todd's Sunflowers.
