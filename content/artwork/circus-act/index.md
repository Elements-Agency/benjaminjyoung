**Circus Act**  presents a haunting and satirical courtroom drama in which a clown—dressed in exaggerated red-and-white stripes with a stern, painted expression—stands accused of being a menace to society. The figure dominates the witness stand, looming uncomfortably large in both presence and implication. Behind him, a row of stone-faced jurors looks on with a mix of judgment and detachment, while silhouetted members of the audience watch the proceedings in silence. The stark lighting and somber tones heighten the absurdity of the scene, turning the courtroom into a stage where societal fears, scapegoating, and spectacle collide. Through this unsettling juxtaposition of comedy and condemnation, Circus Act invites the viewer to question who defines disorder—and whether the real performance lies in the trial itself.

{{< cta artwork="Circus Act" >}}

In this watercolor painting, emotion is conveyed not through chaos, but through an eerie stillness—a heavy atmosphere of judgment, isolation, and quiet condemnation. The clown, a figure typically associated with laughter and lightness, is rendered with a cold, stoic expression, stripped of joy and made grotesque in his context. His painted face becomes a mask of irony, standing trial in a courtroom that feels more like a stage for ritual than a place of truth-seeking. The figures surrounding him—jurors, officials, and spectators—are expressionless, cast in deep shadows, their faces void of empathy or engagement. This emotional detachment speaks to the impersonal machinery of the legal system, where individuals become symbols, and outcomes often hinge less on humanity than on procedure. The painting becomes a meditation on how justice, when stripped of compassion, can transform even the absurd into something solemn, and how in that transformation, dignity and understanding are often the first casualties.

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration for this painting will be expanded upon at a future date, but it was rooted in the inspiration that Edward Hopper brought me in his overlooked masterpiece, Soir Bleu. Tying a scene that correlates to my own feelings and experiences.

### Artwork Process ###

Another large watercolor work. Always working in layers upon layers with watercolor.
