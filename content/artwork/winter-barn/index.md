title: Winter Barn
description: In this watercolor, Ben Young utilizes soft, atmospheric washes and deep cerulean shadows to depict a weathered barn standing in quiet isolation against a stark, snow-swept landscape.
alt: A weathered barn stands as a silent sentinel amidst a vast, snow-covered landscape, captured in soft watercolor washes that emphasize the cool blue shadows of a quiet winter day.
