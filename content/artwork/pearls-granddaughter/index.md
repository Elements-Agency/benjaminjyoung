This gouache painting is a compelling reinterpretation of Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, replacing the original's soft elegance with a bolder, more contemporary edge. The subject’s vivid orange headscarf adds a striking contrast to the dark background, drawing immediate attention to her thoughtful, almost confrontational gaze. The textured brushstrokes and rich, earthy palette give the piece a tactile depth and painterly energy that differentiates it from the smooth subtlety of the original. Her expression, simultaneously vulnerable and strong, invites the viewer into a quiet moment of introspection. Signed in blue by the artist, the work pays homage to a timeless classic while asserting a distinct and personal voice.

### Inspiration ###

{{< img src="pearl.jpg" width="200px" height="237px" class="floatright" gallery="progress" alt="Girl with a Pearl Earring" title="Girl with a Pearl Earring" link="pearl.jpg" >}}

I used Vermeer's Girl with the Pearl Earring as a reference when painting.

### Artwork Process ###

This was my first Gouache painting, so I needed a good study piece. I have used gouache before, but only for small elements of a watercolor painting. I also stuck with using the Zorn limited pallet, including; Titanium White, Yellow Ochre, Cadmium Red Light, and Ivory Black. Selectively using Cobalt Blue on the blouse.
