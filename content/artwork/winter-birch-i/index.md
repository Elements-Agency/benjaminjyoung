This 7x5-inch original watercolor captures the serene, hushed atmosphere of a mid-winter morning. Focused on the striking contrast between the dark, textured bark of twin birch trees and the soft, expansive white of a fresh snowfall, this piece invites the viewer into a moment of absolute stillness.

### Pennsylvania Sentinels ###

This 7x5-inch watercolor was born from a winter drive through the rolling hills of Pennsylvania. While traveling, I found myself captivated by the striking, skeletal beauty of the white sycamores and birches that line the frozen creek beds and snowy fields of the Northeast.

In this piece, I wanted to capture the specific way their bark—mottled with deep greys and warm earth tones—stands in stark defiance against the blinding white of a fresh snowfall. The twin trunks act as a focal point of strength in an otherwise soft, muted world. It is a tribute to those quiet roadside scenes that make a long winter drive feel like a journey through a living gallery.
