tag: She tied you to the kitchen chair. She broke your throne, and she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah! - The man, is myself, when my hair was longer and wild with curls. A time when I was younger. The framing design displays a moment between myself and the woman that is focused and touches briefly on the duality of emotions seeing this painting evokes in me. Much like the meaning and interpretation of the song.

story: /story/hallelujah

**Hallelujah** captures a profound and intimate moment between two figures, a [woman](/tags/number-five) and a [man](/tags/ben), bathed in muted, melancholic tones. The woman, with a look of quiet concentration, gently holds the man’s head as she carefully cuts his hair. The tenderness in her touch contrasts with the rough, darkened surroundings, suggesting a setting filled with history and emotional weight. The man, seated with his back to the viewer, seems resigned, his body language conveying a sense of vulnerability and brokenness. Likely his stone pose shows signs of trauma. His unruly hair and the scattered clippings on his shoulders evoke a passage of time and perhaps a long period of neglect and hardship. Will she cut the ropes that bound him to the chair, allowing to break free, or will she tenderly care for him and ease his woes? Guaranteeing to be a pivotal and defining moment for this pair.

The composition is tightly framed, drawing the viewer’s focus to the emotional connection between the two figures. The dim lighting and earthy palette create a somber mood, emphasizing the gravity of the moment they share. The texture of the background, with its worn and almost decayed appearance, adds to the narrative of endurance and care amidst adversity. This scene, though quiet and understated, resonates with themes of compassion, resilience, and the human need for connection, even in the bleakest of times. The painting speaks to the viewer on a deeply emotional level, inviting reflection on the nuances of care and the quiet strength found in such moments of solace and support. Even in our darkest moments of life.

### Narrative ###

The template for the narrative is set to the song's verse, from Hallelujah, "She tied you to the kitchen chair. She broke your throne, and she cut your hair." The woman will remain unnamed, but may appear in further painting narratives. While my intent was not to paint my [late fiancee](/artwork/number-two) as apart of the narrative, some influence of her face is in this painting. The man, is myself, when my hair was longer and wild with curls. A time when I was younger. The framing design displays a moment between myself and the woman that is focused and touches briefly on the duality of emotions seeing this painting evokes in me. Much like the meaning and interpretation of the song. This is the first painting of [The Dark Trio Collection](/collections/the-dark-trio), which is a collection to touch on three of my most challenging traumas.

### Artwork Process ###

I approached this painting the same way I did with my [Massillon Helmet](/artwork/massillon-helmet). The background was painted a little bit more impasto and looser, as well as the definition of details were not as focused moving away from the focal point of the two faces in the center. This being my biggest painting so far is also my most time consuming thus so far. It was obviously well worth the time spent! I truly love this painting and it's journey. Both how I came to the narrative, how long I held off to practice before tackling it, an of course my love for the actual painting it's self. This design has been in the back of my mind for over six months. It's touching to finally see the finished fruition.
