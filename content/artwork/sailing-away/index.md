title: Sailing Away
description: Silent Reflections is a watercolor painting, set on a misty ocean with rolling mountains in the background. The subject of a schooner boat sailing away at sea.
alt: This painting by Ben Young shows a solitary schooner sailing across a sea, in a muted watercolor landscape shrouded in a misty atmosphere.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: I planned this painting months ago and only did the wash. It sat until I started working on a commission, after completing Silent Reflections. Sitting in the park outside the Stark County court house, I somehow completed this quickly, working on it in between the drying layers of my other painting. This painting just seemed to "click" and I stayed what I assume most watercolor artists refer as "loose".

This watercolor painting, **Sailing Away**, depicts a solitary schooner boat navigating through misty waters. The scene is serene and atmospheric, with soft, muted colors creating a sense of calm and tranquility. The sailboat, with its sails billowing gently, is positioned towards the right side of the painting, moving forward through the slightly choppy, dark blue waves. The background features indistinct, hazy mountains that blend seamlessly with the overcast sky, enhancing the overall misty ambiance. The use of watercolor techniques adds a fluid and ethereal quality to the painting, capturing the essence of a quiet journey through a tranquil seascape.

### Inspiration ###

I honestly just wanted to work on some water effect techniques. I picked adding a sailboat and misty mountains in the background as a secondary objective. Seemed like a cool idea.
