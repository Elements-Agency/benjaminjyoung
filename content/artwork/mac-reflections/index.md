The Mac Reflections painting depicts a close-up impressionism portrait of myself, rendered with a strong emphasis on texture and a limited color palette, to show it's reflective nature. My figure is implied to be either emerging from or sinking into a dark background, with light only faintly illuminating the right side of the face. The strokes are expressive and almost sculptural, creating an array of thick, impasto strokes that give the image a dynamic and tactile quality.

The choice of colors—greys, blacks, and touches of white—contribute to a somber and introspective atmosphere. My expression is pensive and subdued, with eyes cast downward and away from the viewer, adding to the painting’s introspective quality.

There is a sense of depth and dimension, despite the darkness that envelops the figure. The use of light and shadow is masterful, creating a lifelike representation that captures the complexity of human emotion.

The overall effect is one of profound reflection, with the textured brushwork and dramatic chiaroscuro suggesting a moment captured in time, where the inner world of the subject is as significant as the outer representation. It’s a powerful image that invites the viewer to consider the subject’s thoughts and feelings.

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration came to me from seeing my reflection in the darkened and smudged glossy screen from Apple MacBook Pro. I really like the depth and effect of how it looked, so it struck me to try to convey that same emotion to paper. My choice was to stay with what I enjoy best, impressionism. Broad strokes of oil pastels is what I decided on, after already recently completing [Ms. Cezanne](/artwork/ms-cezanne/).

This took a few days of stepping away from the art, getting a fresh pair of eyes, and continuing to develop the depth of the artwork.

Ben Young in childhood, with his artistic talents, started to home in on impressionism as his preferred methodology. It's been some time since he's used those artistic skills, but this artwork is one of many where those talents are starting to bubble back to the service as Ben ventures back in to visual arts.
