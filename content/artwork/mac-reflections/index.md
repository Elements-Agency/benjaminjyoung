title: Mac Reflections
description: Mac Reflections is a self portrait inspired after seeing seeing my reflection on a glossy and smudged laptop screen, after the screen going dark. I was inspired so much by the tone and effect of it, I wanted to try to carry over that depth on paper with oil pastels.
