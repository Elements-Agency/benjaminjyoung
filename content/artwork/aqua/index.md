title: Aqua
description: Aqua is my second water painting done with Water Soluble Pencil, to display water splashing out of a wine glass.
alt: The painting displays an artistic monochrome sketch of a wine glass with its contents in mid-splash, creating an elegant and dynamic fluid motion captured in a still moment.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: This was drawn with a water soluble pencil on some cold press wood pulp watercolor paper. It only took about a hour to test and do, and was a test drawing before continuing on to start Drip.

This is a striking monochrome painting that captures a moment of fluid elegance, titled simply **Aqua**. It depicts a wine glass caught in the midst of a dynamic swirl, with the liquid inside defying gravity in a graceful arc that stretches above the rim. The movement is frozen in time, with the liquid's surface tension creating an almost sculptural form that reaches upwards. The artist has skillfully represented the play of light and shadow, giving the impression of a sparkling, translucent liquid. The glass's thin stem and stable base contrast with the liquid's volatility, providing a sense of balance to the composition. The simplicity of the background ensures all attention is focused on the interaction between the glass and its contents, highlighting the delicate beauty of a fleeting moment that would otherwise be missed.

I was curious to try a study of trying to make realistic looking water and glass, using the new water soluble pencils I had just bought.
