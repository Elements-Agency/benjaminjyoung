Nortern Cardinal is a colored pencil drawing of a [Northern Cardinal](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/overview) perched on a branch. The bird is depicted with a vibrant red plumage, which is characteristic of the male of the species. Its beak is orange-yellow, and the facial mask is black, extending from the beak around the eyes. The drawing captures the distinct crest of the cardinal, which is a pointy tuft of feathers on top of its head. The branch is rendered with a muted gray tone, contrasting with the bright red of the bird. The background is a soft, textured gray, allowing the cardinal to stand out prominently. The pencil strokes have created a sense of softness and detail, particularly in the feathers and the blending of colors.

### Inspiration ###

The inspiration came to me one morning, after watching a Cardinal eat some seed I had left out on my back patio.

### Process ###

Anytime I do realism such as this, it's quite time intensive. This artwork took a few weeks of stages of coming back to it and doing a little progress at a time.
