tag: This quaint winter scene showcases a Fruitcake delivery truck and it's driver preparing to drop off it's abundant order of 30 fruitcakes to the anxiously awaiting recipient in the blue snow covered house. A wasteful purchase that would later go on to be donated to the local food bank, with an absurd and humorous smile. The package handler's confident movements inferring that him and homeowner inside are intertwined in scandalous love affair. The calmness of the winter night should be heard in mind. It's left up to the viewer to form their own opinions of what the delivery figure may be thinking or what will transpire when the door bell rings.

Based on December 22nd, 2020: **Fruitcake Delivery** is just in time for the upcoming holidays, this quaint winter scene showcases a Fruitcake delivery truck and it's driver preparing to drop off it's abundant order of 30 fruitcakes to the anxiously awaiting recipient in the blue snow covered house. A wasteful purchase that would later go on to be donated to the local food bank, with an absurd and humorous smile. The package handler's confident movements inferring that him and homeowner inside are intertwined in scandalous love affair. The glow of light from the windows adds to the charm of the painting. The neighbor's house seems set in but yet still glowing with life. As is with the main focus of the blue house with white trim, with it's windows inviting a sense of warmness away from the cold wind. The calmness of the winter night should be heard in mind. It's left up to the viewer to form their own opinions of what the delivery figure may be thinking or what will transpire when the door bell rings.

### Inspiration ###

The scene is painted and altered from my own memory of some shenanigans I've been involved in with the past. Nothing more than silly humor, but it was ultimately what triggered the start of a long and complicated chain of events that would lead to me starting painting.

### Artwork Process ###

Sticking to my natural style, I start off with a wash using wet-on-wet. Then building up middle layers using wet-on-dry, to then finalize the painting with a lot of dry-on-dry brush marks. The painting consists of hundreds if not thousands of layers of watercolor painting. Building on each time to the depth of values and to as fine detail as I can achieve with the lack of control of the watercolor medium. As I have been becoming more and more familiar with my preference of tones, I am introducing more and more earthy pigments, especially yellow ochre and burnt umber in this piece.
