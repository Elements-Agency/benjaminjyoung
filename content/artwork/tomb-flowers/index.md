progress: Drawn with watercolor pencil on cold press wood pulp watercolor paper. I used a wash on the background, using water, to turn the pencil shading in to paint. The subject of the flower was left dried as a drawing.

The flower is that of a white lily. It was the favorite flower of my late Fiancee. We had planned to utilized them in our wedding. Only to be used for her funeral instead.
