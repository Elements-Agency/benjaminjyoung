title: Drip
description: Drip is a water realism painting, showing the rippling effect of a water drop, painted with water soluable graphite pencil.
alt: The painting presents a grayscale watercolor painting of a water droplet creating ripples on the surface of water, captured in a moment of dynamic symmetry and fluid motion.
author: Benjamin J. Young

progress: Using a water soluble graphite pencil on cold press watercolor wood pulp paper. I spent an evening the next morning, trying to focus on the right amount of values and blending, to give it the best realism for my skill-level.

The **Drip** painting captures the ephemeral beauty of a single water droplet impacting a still surface. A central column of water rises sharply, surrounded by a crown of droplets reflecting the moment's dynamic motion. The surface tension creates a series of concentric ripples that emanate outward, masterfully rendered in varying shades of grey, suggesting the gentle yet persistent spread of energy away from the point of impact. The artist has skillfully used a monochromatic palette to depict the clarity and purity of water, with careful attention to the gradations of light and shadow that give the scene a three-dimensional quality. The painting combines precision and softness, immortalizing a fleeting instance of natural harmony.

I was curious to try a study of trying to make realistic looking water, using the new water soluble pencils I had just bought.
